<p>MirandaNet Fellows were often involved in research projects funded by Becta (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becta">British Educational Communications and Technology Agency</a>), a public body funded by the Department for Education in the United Kingdom to oversee the procurement and use of computers in schools.Becta was closed down by the coalition government of 2010-2015. In response, Christina Preston, MirandaNet Founder, wrote an article in response, almost an obituary, summing up the loss felt by the wider community and outlining concerns about the future of professional development for technology in teaching and learning: <a href="../the-demise-of-becta-2010-its-value-on-the-world-stage/index.html">The Demise of Becta 2010: its value on the world stage.</a></p>
<p>Here, MirandaNet has reassembled over 300 research reports, project reports and advice documents that were published by Becta.</p>
<p>These were undertaken by the professional community and they still have value both for current practice and to provide a starting point for future research and professional development programmes as well as an important archive of past work in educational technology.</p>
<p>If you know of any Becta documents that are not listed, or entries that require corrections (e.g. many are undated) please write to: <a href="mailto:editor@mirandanet.ac.uk">editor@mirandanet.ac.uk</a>).</p>

Research now shows that technology can help to: • motivate learners and keep them engaged in learning; • improve attainment levels and raise standards; • personalise learning and give learners a voice; • make difficult and abstract concepts easier to explore; • save you time and be more efficient; • open up dialogue with parents and extend learning;<br />
• make learners partners in their formal learning; • reach the hard-to-reach.<br />
Your learners are already engaging with technology both in and out of school. Are you? This booklet will help you discover what it takes to become a 21st century teacher.</td><td class="column-3"><a href='../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/21st_century_teacher.pdf'/>21st Century Teacher</a></td><td class="column-4">ICT, Technology, Secondary, Primary, Teaching and Learning</td>

As a result, an increasing number of employers are turning to technology to help them.<br />
This study identified a range of evidence from employers (private and public) who reported business benefits from their use of learning technologies. The focus was on evidence that supports business-related outcomes (such as sales increase, cost savings, staff retention and so on) rather than learning inputs (such as volume, completion rates or learner satisfaction).</td><td class="column-3"><a href='../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/delivering_results_with_learning_technologies.pdf'/>Delivering results with learning technologies in the workplace: Evidence for employer efficiencies and tangible business benefits</a></td><td class="column-4">Technology, Workplace, Collaboration, VLE, Business, Learning and Development</td>

It has long been accepted that parents’ engagement in their children’s learning at all stages is one of the most important factors in the success of a child at school. It also influences parents’ own relationships to learning and wider learning in the family. When used effectively, technology makes a vital contribution to learning, teaching and management. It also supports effective communication across and beyond the school. Parents can be kept informed about key areas of their child’s development and education. This helps them engage positively with their children’s learning and allows them to have more information available to them to help in constructive ways. Schools can also work with parents to manage continuity of learning during transitions and school closures. This works well when technology-based communication is established as part of the regular routine of school life.</td><td class="column-3"><a href='../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mfte_engagingfamilies.pdf'/>Engaging with families</a></td><td class="column-4">Technology, Parents, Teaching and Learning, Learning Platforms, Collaboration</td>

Where technology is used well, evidence demonstrates that significant benefits for learners can be achieved. The Harnessing Technology Grant represents an important investment grant to support developments that will benefit all learners. However, delivering better outcomes by using technology to improve services requires determined and co-ordinated approaches at school, local and national levels, and local authorities have an important role to play. On 3 March 2009 Becta published its Harnessing Technology implementation plan for children, schools and families. This outlines specific goals and priorities for the sector and identifies actions that national and intermediary partners will together work to deliver in order to support change.</td><td class="column-3"><a href='../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ht_funding_las.pdf'/>Harnessing Technology funding 2009–10: Guidance for local authorities</a></td><td class="column-4">ICT, Technology, Funding, Local Authorities, eSafety, Parents</td>

The second edition goes further, addressing key concerns of those who must lead the way to effective management and implementation. One message comes through strongly: only if leaders show an interest will others follow. Change is challenging and people need good reasons to pursue it.

These schools have been chosen because they are doing interesting things with modest equipment, and the activities they have developed could be replicated in any school.<br />

This report focuses in particular on the quality of the opportunities to learn with ICT provided to pupils, and whether there is any link to improved standards. The evidence from this study suggests that ICT should be regarded as central to the effort to improve standards, and that those schools which have been able to provide good opportunities to learn with ICT have benefited in terms of pupil attainment, motivation and attendance.</td><td class="column-3"><a href='../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/secondary_schools_standards_full.pdf'/>Secondary Schools – ICT and Standards: An analysis of national data from Ofsted and QCA by Becta</a></td><td class="column-4">ICT, technology, Secondary, Leadership, STEM, Teaching and Learning, VLE, Collaboration, Parents, Professional Practice, Inclusion</td>

Instead they encourage teachers to use generic software such as word processors and data-handling programs when relevant to lesson objectives.<br />

Using internet-based resources need not be a stand-alone activity. Pupils need to see the internet as only one of a range of sources of information, and should be encouraged to compare and combine findings from books, pictures and other media as well as internet sites. Internet searches can be used in combination with other software such as word processors to help pupils to construct historical arguments in which the web resources are used to illustrate a point. Some pupils will benefit from the use of word-processing techniques to help them to analyse texts such as primary sources found on the web, before drawing conclusions about their point of view, their accuracy or the extent to which they are related to other sources.</td><td class="column-3"><a href='../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wbr_secondary_history.pdf'/>Using web-based resources in Secondary History<br />

When considering the impact of ICT in education there often tends to be a focus on whether, and to what extent, ICT can raise pupil achievement; although this is an important aspect and a measure of a school’s performance, there are many other factors which can reflect the extent to which a school is improving. The purpose of this briefing is to identify the ways in which ICT can assist with all of these factors, including: ● raising pupil motivation; ● improving pupil behaviour; ● enhancing communications both within and between schools; ● enhancing assessment methods and their impact; ● reducing teacher workload; ● increasing efficiency in school management.</td><td class="column-3"><a href='../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wtrs_ws_improvement.pdf'/>What the research says about ICT and whole-school improvement</a></td><td class="column-4">ICT, Technology, Professional Practice, VLE, Communities, Collaboration, Teaching and Learning, Assessment, MIS, Parents</td>
