We have continued to investigate this topic this year, and this is feeding into Ofsted\u2019s thinking about how we will inspect from 2019 onwards. In this session I will reflect on our findings to date and give an insight into the areas of focus that are driving our current approach. One of the issues we are interested in is how inspections can assess performance in different subject areas, while preserving the important principle that Ofsted does not have a preferred curriculum.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p>Amelia is Deputy Director with responsibility for Ofsted\u2019s research and evaluation programme. This includes oversight of Amanda Spielman\u2019s new multi-year research programme into the curriculum across all phases of education. Previously in Ofsted she was responsible for the Chief Inspector\u2019s Annual Reports and published eight of these across schools, early years, children\u2019s social care and further education and skills under Sir Michael Wilshaw. Before joining Ofsted she led research on services for older people, localising justice and housing for the LGiU, a local government thinktank. She has previously had strategy and policy roles in local government and the civil service.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQVej_PJttAtj87eJ1WJuJAyWXLbYMZdwNVJ9AT1heM7O5O-bFNwJp4e8YF7tRrRIFXlpk3e-ZC6ZyZ\/embed?start=false&#038;loop=false&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"1280\" height=\"749\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/keynote_ofsted.pdf\">Click here to download the slides.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amelia Walker Over the past year we have conducted extensive research on the curriculum in primary schools.
