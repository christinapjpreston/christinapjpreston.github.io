I taught in secondary schools for many years, and then I worked at NCET &#8211; Becta &#8211; on a variety of projects to do with the use of ICT in teaching and learning. On leaving Becta I undertook a number of projects including web site support. I edited existing sites, tinkered with them to improve the way that they displayed, re-wrote them, and then later I began to develop web sites from scratch. For the technically minded, these sites included flat HTML sites, sites with PHP routines, sites which were largely running out of MySQL databases using Perl or PHP routines. There were sites which ran on Apache servers, sites on a First Class server and even on an IIS server with ASP, and there were several examples which exploited Digital Brain&#8217;s London Grid for Learning routines. As web expectations for accessibility increased, many of these sites were then completely re-written to be accessible and to display successfully on the full range of devices from small smartphones through tablets to full-scale PCs.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7197 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/RMrosette.png\" alt=\"Rosette\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Andree Jordan<\/h4>\n<div style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"border-radius: 9%; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; border: 2PX #9e152c SOLID;\" src=\"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/andreej.jpeg\" alt=\"Andree Jordan\" width=\"140\" height=\"122\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andree Jordan<\/p><\/div>\n<p>After her degree in Life Sciences, Andree Jordan became a teacher of Science at Secondary level. Becoming Head of Department for Health and Social Care, she completed an M.A. in Education Management and over the years ran departments of Psychology, of Social Sciences and ran courses for teachers in ICT. She trained Classroom assistants for their NVQs and led courses in Childcare. However, her greatest love over her teaching career has been as International Coordinator for her school. This began in 1999 with a link developed by her husband David Jordan to a Comenius Project called \u201cHealthy Europe\u201d where learners in her school worked with others from European schools to develop a \u201cCharter for Health\u201d across the schools. With the opportunity arising in 2004 to go to South Africa with MirandaNet to kickstart ICT as a tool in the classroom, Andr\u00e9e discovered \u201cThe Peace Room\u201d &#8211; an actual building in a garden that became Andr\u00e9e\u2019s passion. With the help of MirandaNet, and Francis Howlett, she took information about the actual Peace Room and created a web resource which could be used by children all over the world to nominate and debate candidates who \u201chave made the world a better place\u201d. It has since been used by children in all continents of the world, and has been a superb classroom tool, encouraging not only writing skills, but research and debating skills, linking children to others around the world, broadening their horizons and hopefully encouraging peace and making the world a better place. <\/p>\n<p>Sadly the coding for the site no longer works and Andree (now retired) is working on reinstating the site in a form for today\u2019s children in today\u2019s world  following in the footsteps of her father who wrote about a family holiday in France \u201cif our children can play on the beach together today, then surely there is hope for a brighter future\u201d. <\/p>\n<p>For more information visit: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/profile.php?id=100093471606021 <br \/>\nOr contact Andr\u00e9e Jordan at ajglobalise21c@gmail.com <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7197 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/RMrosette.png\" alt=\"Rosette\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Theo Keuchel<\/h4>\n<div style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"border-radius: 9%; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; border: 2PX #9e152c SOLID;\" src=\"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/theo.jpg\" alt=\"Theo Keuchel\" width=\"140\" height=\"122\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Theo Keuchel<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Since graduating in Fine Art from Hornsey College of Art in 1972 Theo taught Art\/Design &#038; Technology in Bradford schools for 14 years before becoming an Advisor for ICT in Art. <\/p>\n<p>Following 5 years providing support to Bradford Schools he set up his own business providing consultancy and training in computer graphics for industry and education.

MirandaNet had a partnership with the leading companies which through the 90s and early 2000s were developing the use and application of educational technologies. This partnership meant that teachers could have access to the latest research and development knowledge held by companies, at their fingertips and in return they advised on and tested educational applications developed by the companies.<\/p>\n<p>Marilyn has been a teacher, researcher, secondary school assistant head, local authority policy officer, researcher, author, editor, dean and professor and has had policy roles in two UK national agencies. She trained as a science teacher at London\u2019s UCL Institute of Education in 1980. Computing was her second specialism. As a new teacher she was involved from early on in a national initiative which transformed the secondary curriculum in England to a technology rich curriculum and the introduction of personal computers into schools. In the London Borough of Enfield, she was school coordinator for this initiative &#8211; the  Technical Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI, 1983-1990ish). She was trained as a teacher researcher as part of her role in TVEI following the Lawrence Stenhouse model and her MPhil thesis in the University of Cambridge library deals definitively and positively with issues often raised about the reliability and validity of teacher research. Her current work includes developing national and international models for scaling up promising small-scale research. <\/p>\n<p>Over 45 year career in education she has been a professor at Brunel University and the University of Bedfordshire where she was also Dean of Education. As well as research undertaken in his academic posts, she spent a number of years as a full-time researcher at the University of Cambridge and at the National Foundation for Educational Research. In these rules she was involved in national and international research projects focused for the most part around the use and adoption of emerging technologies in the education sector.<\/p>\n<p>She held senior knowledge management roles at two national agencies: the Improvement and Development Agency for local government \u2013 part of the national Local Government Association and the Training and Development Agency for Schools in which was part of the government Department for Education in England. In these roles her job was to use the opportunities offered through online technologies to share and build knowledge bases for the local government sector and the teacher training sector. <\/p>\n<p>Her research over 35 years has been in teacher knowledge, whole system change, improvement and development across large systems, evidence-informed policy and practice, and the use of digital technologies in education. She led several national multi-million pound national initiatives in her central government officer knowledge management role. <\/p>\n<p>In 1992, she initiated what has become the major textbook series used for secondary teacher training in the UK: <a href=\"https:\/\/learningtoteach.routledge.com\/?gclid=CjwKCAjw7c2pBhAZEiwA88pOF2PShMOjem2WJtAWrxxLq2c_Pn4-VrU3Jehl32VrFqSxQzWXXNnCnRoCaJkQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Learning to Teach in the Secondary School series published by Routledge Taylor Francis.<\/a>  The series has a core textbook which covers general principles and teacher education and then subject specific textbooks for all major subject areas which themselves are accompanied by books which are practical guides.<\/p>\n<p>Her desire to underpin the advice in these texts with research drives her research into the evidence base underpinning teaching. She has published widely on this topic. <\/p>\n<p>At the Training and Development Agency for schools she brought together subject associations and colleagues across the education sector to establish the Teacher Training Resource Bank (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ttrb.ac.uk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.ttrb.ac.uk<\/a> &#8211;  closed by Michael Gove in 2010) and associated subject resource networks. At the national Improvement and Development Agency for local government she set up online communities for local government using what became the Knowledge Hub (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.khub.net\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.khub.net<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The closure of the Teacher Training Resource Bank led to the establishment of the Education Futures Collaboration charity to take forward this work.  See www.meshguides.org.<\/p>\n<p>She was elected by peers to a number of national positions &#8211; as a panel member on the 2008 UK Research Assessment Exercise and on the boards for the Association for IT in Teacher Education now the Technology, Pedagogy and Education Association (TPEA), the UK Council for Subject Associations, the British Educational Research Association, the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers. She has held advisory roles for the OECD and the British Council and given keynote speeches in many many countries on knowledge mobilisation for education and the possibilities afforded by digital technologies.<\/p>\n<p>She was awarded lifelong membership by her professional association, TPEA, in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>She, with Professor Younie, was instrumental, with international colleagues, in establishing the European Schoolnet (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eun.org\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.eun.org<\/a>) in 1995 which connects classrooms in collaborative projects across Europe. This initiative is sustainable thanks to the support of 34 ministries of education across Europe which is a model proposed for the MESH initiative. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7197 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/RMrosette.png\" alt=\"Rosette\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Bozena Mannova<\/h4>\n<div style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"border-radius: 9%; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; border: 2PX #9e152c SOLID;\" src=\"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Boba-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bozena Mannova\" width=\"140\" height=\"122\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bozena Mannova<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Bozena Mannova has been teaching since 1989 at the Department of Computer Science, Czech Technical University in Prague courses Programming, Data Structures and Software Engineering.

I am a Senior MirandaNet Fellow and World Peace Ambassador, and have represented the United Kingdom at international ICT conferences for the DfES and BECTA.<\/p>\n<p>My interests are in literacy, creative uses of ICT\/Computing, cross-curricular teaching and learning, and in international collaborations.

I had created a series of classroom projects using ICT tools, and was invited by Professor Christina Preston to present some of this work at that conference.  I was reluctant to attend, but was eventually persuaded.  At the event, however. I met three people who changed the whole course of my professional life.  The first was a British Council science editor (\u201cScience Education Newsletter\u201d), who asked me to write up this and subsequent projects for publication, which began a long and fruitful collaboration with the British Council.  <\/p>\n<p>The second delegate was Professor Hiro Tanaka from Osaka Kyoiku University, who invited me to teach at his university, which, once again, resulted in many highly regarded UK-Japan collaborations in music, dance and drama, using video-conferencing equipment.  This culminated in a BBC TV programme, \u201cBlue Peter\u201d about the shared bi-lingual drama, \u201cKabuki Gift\u201d between my London school and an Osaka school, work which was subsequently included un the Japanese National Curriculum.<\/p>\n<p>The third delegate was Dr. Karel Vosatka, a teacher from the Czech Technical University in Prague, who invited me to attend their \u201cPoskole\u201d series of international conferences, which I continued to do, with a new project each year, for the next 15 years, working also with Dr. Miroslava \u010cernochov\u00e1, Charles University, Prague. This also started a \u201cdomino\u201d effect across Europe: at Poskole, I met a Professor from Poland, Dr. Maciej Syslo, who, having visited my classroom in London, invited me to teach at his (then) University in Wroclaw, and subsequently to feed some of our computing projects into the Polish National Curriculum.  From there, I was further invited to the University of Varna, Bulgaria, and then to Skopje and Bitola Universities in Macedonia.  <\/p>\n<p>Many aspects of this work are posted on the archived MirandaNet website, following a MirandaNet conference that I very nearly did not attend!   <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7197 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/RMrosette.png\" alt=\"Rosette\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Sarah Younie<\/h4>\n<div style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"border-radius: 9%; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; border: 2PX #9e152c SOLID;\" src=\"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Dr-Sarah-Younie-e1423670201327.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Younie\" width=\"140\" height=\"122\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sarah Younie<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Professor Younie has been involved in international and national teaching and research on educational technologies for over twenty-five years.
