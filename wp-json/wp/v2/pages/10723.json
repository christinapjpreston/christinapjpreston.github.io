The project sought to evaluate the implementation, and analyse the potential benefits and challenges of introducing a western based tool, the VLE, into an international context where English may not be the first language and where there may be a different culture of learning and pedagogy.\u00a0 The project identified key considerations for Higher Education in developing VLEs in the West for use with transnational courses in the East.\u00a0 A key outcome of the project was the creation of a wiki and blog to provide further support and learning opportunity for students in Hong Kong and the UK; the wiki has engendered a robust research environment with students in both countries working together to co-construct new knowledge at doctoral level.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Am-I-a-Researcher-yet.pdf\">Read the Paper<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cross cultural comparison: the introduction of new technology with post-graduate students in Hong Kong and in the United Kingdom.
