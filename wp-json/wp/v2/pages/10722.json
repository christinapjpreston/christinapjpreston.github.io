In these programmes teachers participate as co-researchers to define, measure and report on the impact of innovation on learning in their classroom and their school.<\/p>\n<p>MirandaNet has a unique reputation in the market for independence, credibility and market leading research into technology and innovation. Through action research, MirandaNet works with associates to define, measure and report on the impact their products and services have on learning.<\/p>\n<p>Our action research methodology gives the school time to reflect of the use of technology and analyse its use, effectiveness and impact. This offers the school a rare chance to review best practice and the way they deploy innovation to enhance learning. For our associates, it gives them valuable feedback on their products, product feedback and quantified evidence of learning.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our services include:\n<ul>\n<li>Sprint: Product impact\n<ul>\n<li>Action research workshop to measure the impact of technology and innovation in teaching and learning.

With low impact, operational CPD, accredited research and low impact strategic decision-making we give the school a chance to reflect, learn and enhance their skills and knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>By amalgamating action research and CPD the action research methodology becomes an operational process in schools, managing change.
