Even in Educational Technology some principles endure.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure such knowledge is not lost, members of  MESHGuides, MirandaNet Fellowship, Naace and TPEA are working together to collate and reassemble research findings about education technology that were produced pre-2010 but still have relevance today.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the summaries have been published previously in the Naace journal.

Please get in touch if you would like your work represented here and also recommend this opportunity to others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The background<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Back to the Future in Education Innovation will be the last contribution of the MirandaNet Fellowship (<a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\">mirandanet.ac.uk<\/a>) to the international education technology community.<\/p>\n<p.We established the MirandaNet Fellowship in 1992 and we now have 1,400 international members. One of the most important contributions members have made to research is to the Knowledge Hub [MAKE THE LINK LIVE] where the history of digital technologies in education can be traced over three decades. There are many other reports the Knowledge Hub that will be helpful to educators across the curriculum interested in using educational technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last five years Miranda has worked closely with the Technology Pedagogy and Education Association  (TPEA formerly ITTE) on various activities and we feel that the time has come to merge the two memberships. We will also archive the Mirandanet website so that all the resources can still be searched. <\/p>\n<p>We also want to merge the two mail lists and promote the kind of lively discussion that seems to have disappeared during Covid. We believe this can be done quite smoothly as TPEA has a free membership level as well as costed levels. Plans for the membership transfer are pending and members will be contacted.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px dotted #93152c;\" \/>\n<p><strong>A growing list of references pre-dating 2010.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>M<\/h4>\n<p>Manches, A., Phillips, B., Crook, C., Chowcat, I. and Sharples, M.
