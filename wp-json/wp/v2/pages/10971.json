This project started its life in 2002 by two school improvement advisers &#8211; Mike Bostock and Bob Percival &#8211; based on techniques evolved from working with school leaders over the years, and from Ofsted inspection work.<\/p>\n<p>4Matrix is a powerful, remarkably low-cost, SQL database-driven networked application that is designed to look and feel like other Microsoft software packages such as Office. It can be used across a school network by all teachers and managed by a data manager. Teachers can use 4Matrix to investigate the effectiveness of teaching and learning &#8211; without needing to be statisticians.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>4Matrix provides power tools for use at key stages 3, 4 and 5, which can be used to analyse, compare, forecast and report on the performance of subjects, the quality of learning, the progress made by different groups of pupils, and the consistency and impact of teaching. 4Matrix will import and automatically process rich data directly from all major MIS in minutes, or you can easily copy and paste from spreadsheets. Any number of data series can be imported into 4Matrix, including exam results, Levels, estimated grades or target grades.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>4Matrix is a networked solution which will keep your sensitive data securely within your school, but it can also be used from home using MS Remote Apps, VPN or an application like Teamviewer. During 2016 we will be releasing a &#8216;Go Anywhere&#8217; version of 4Matrix<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><br \/>\n <\/span><\/p>\n<p>4Matrix aims to be the most comprehensive secondary school performance data system available at an affordable price. We concentrate on development rather than promotion &#8211; so we may not be the first company in this market that you hear about. We listen to our customers and aim to turn their suggestions into our priorities.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":10934,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-10971","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","no-post-thumbnail"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10971"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10971"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10971\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10934"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10971"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
