They write cogently on digital literacy issues that have tended to be side-lined because of the recent emphasis on Computing, particularly the emphasis on coding. The style is friendly and accessible and the emphasis on a holistic, cross curricular approach is welcome with clear links to the relevant sections of the new National Curriculum.<\/p>\n<p>Primary teachers are encouraged to consider digital literacies in plural because there are wide-ranging aspects: for example the role of the teacher as well that of the children as authors as well as consumers of digital content, working individually or collaboratively. The authors acknowledge that today\u2019s learners face very different challenges and opportunities in learning with technology when compared to their teachers\u2019 school experiences. They make a valuable distinction between technological determinism and implementing technology for reasons that are pedagogically sound. The aim is that primary teachers should use technology with a purpose, to achieve authentic goals and share with an audience when appropriate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digital Literacy for primary teachers Moira Savage and Antony Barnett. 2015.
