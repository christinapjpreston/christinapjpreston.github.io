At last, a face-to-face conference with a strong education innovation approach. Four key professional associations in digital education are collaborating to share our knowledge: Naace, MESHGuides, MirandaNet Fellowship  and the Technology, Pedagogy and Education Association (Formerly ITTE). \r\nWe are looking for contributors especially those who have learnt more ways of making digital education effective during the pandemic. Do join us also for the MirandaNet party celebrating this edtech professionals collaboration since 1992. Now all the MirandaNet resources will be transferred to the TPEA website to ensure their value to the professional for many years to come. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>100 sign-ups are needed by the end of April<\/strong><br>\r\nDespite this upbeat encouragement to you all, as we are sure is the case for many of your institutions, the higher education sector in the UK is experiencing serious financial challenges, and as a small, niche university, Bath Spa is no exception, indeed, it is particularly vulnerable. Therefore, we cannot run the ICET World Assembly (WA) at a loss and we must inform you that the BSU conferencing team have imposed the deadline of the end of April for us to have signed up 100 people for the World Assembly  to break even. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Travel restrictions <\/strong><br>\r\n\r\nIn terms of travel to the UK, there are now no legal restrictions and although there is still a relatively high incidence of covid infection, the rates of serious illness and hospitalisation are greatly reduced. At Bath Spa and in the Apex Hotel precautions are in place and we think that you can all be reasonably confident of a safe stay.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>From the ICET conference committee<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linda La Velle, Christina Preston, Sarah Younie<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about speaking email christina@mirandanet.ac.uk<\/p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/From the ICET conference committee  Linda La Velle, Christina Preston, Sarah Younie  For more information about speaking email christina@mirandanet.ac.uk\"><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ICET-2022-call-v3-2.pdf\">Here is the call.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ICET-2022-Proposed-Programme-v1-2.pdf\">Here is the programme.<\/a>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCUP Annual Luncheon at the House of Lords 20th May 2022 11.45am \u2013 2.30pm This annual event is to be held again following the restrictions of the pandemic.
