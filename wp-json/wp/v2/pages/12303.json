In this belief the Technology, Pedagogy and Education Association (TPEA <a href=\"http:\/\/tpea.ac.uk\/\">http:\/\/tpea.ac.uk<\/a> ) is being established, a learned society that aims to inform about EdTech policy and practice in government, schools, colleges and teacher education. in this context, the Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education is now changing its name to TPEA and collaborating with the MirandaNet Fellowship (<a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\">http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com<\/a>) and their associate companies who engage in practice based research. Each organisation boasts more than thirty years of expertise and knowledge of members and a combined international membership of more than 1,400. TPEA\u2019s international members represent a wide range of education technology experts including university and college lecturers, advisory services and independent consultants, school leaders, classroom teachers, researchers and associate EdTech companies. <\/p> \n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <th><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/BJDEducation.png\" width=\"200\"><\/center><\/th>\n    <th><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/dotcom.jpg\" width=\"200\"><\/center><\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <th><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/iris-logo-300x170-1.jpg\" width=\"200\"><\/center><\/th>\n    <th><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/image001-1.png\" width=\"200\"><\/center><\/th>\n    <th><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Routledge_RGB.jpg\" width=\"200\"><\/center><\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\n<p>We offer a busy programme at BETT 2020 that includes: <ul>\n<li>an invitation for EdTech professionals to join Tim Berners Lee\u2019s Call to Action to improve the web; <\/li>\n<li>a presentation on the iCatalyst professional development practice-based research programme that involves teachers as co-researchers; <\/li>\n<li>three safaris where BETT20 tourists attend a talk on the research findings that teachers have published and then join a guided tour to visit relevant EdTech companies.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\n\n\n<h5>TPEA, Stand SD72, South Hall <\/h5>\n\n<p>Experts on research into EdTech products and services will be available on our stand, SD72 South Hall, to discuss with companies how TPEA can communicate the value of their product or service in teaching and learning.  <\/p>\n<p>Contact Professor Christina Preston for a stand appointment <br>christina@mirandanet.ac.uk <\/p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Can we \u2018Fix the Web\u2019 together?<\/h3>\n<h5>Powerful pedagogies emerging from digital opportunities<\/h5>\n\n<p><em>Led by Emeritus Professor Mike Sharples, Open University <\/p>\n<p>TPEA Event, South Gallery Suite 2 1500 24th January<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Tim Berners Lee developed the World Wide Web through bricolage, as a member of CERN at the centre of a huge network of scientists with the aim of supporting access to knowledge within their community and beyond. \u201cIn this case,\u201d asks Dr Mike Sharples, \u201cwhat went wrong? How can we fix the WWW? Scientists and technologists are trying to create a more decentralised \u2018web for good\u2019. But that&#8217;s not enough. We need to involve professionals who understand pedagogy in that endeavour, so that the web is not just decentralised, but also valuable, educational, ethical. We should be working alongside the web technologists to create a \u2018web for good\u2019 not just disseminating what they produce.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Come and join members of the Technology, Pedagogy and Education Association (TPEA) to discuss these issues and answer the Call to Action that has been issued by Berners Lee. Refreshments will be available, and members will join together afterwards for an informal supper at 18:30.
