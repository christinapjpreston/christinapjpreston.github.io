Underpinning it all is the belief that everyone has a role to play in transforming education, and that education should be accessible and exciting for each and every student. The BETT team have also worked with EDUCATE to create useful questions for educators to pose to suppliers so they can be confident in their decision-making, with these tips from leaders who have been to the show for many years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The new owners of BETT are using some key strategies to improve the educational value of the show which had been dropping in the face of commercial pressures. The actions they have taken are to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>set up a Bett Advisory board that meets monthly, comprised of head teachers from around the country, education consultants and academics. The advisors input to the agenda and the programme.<\/li>\n<li>more practitioners than before are taking centre stage.<\/li>\n<li>the Bett Arena editorially selected content is all free. No one has paid to be speak there.<\/li>\n<li>the introduction of a Peer-to-Peer lounge, a place for educators to meet up with each other where there are no suppliers, and no sales pitches!<\/li>\n<li>the Bett Arena has extended opening hours until 7.30pm each week day, designed for local educators to be able to attend after school hours, or for those wanting to travel home from the show after peak travel time<\/li>\n<li>the sister show Education Show has moved to be alongside Bett on the thursday and friday of Bett), offering all non-edtech school supplies such as furniture, equipment and teaching resources. This strategy puts under one roof the full range of education items whether edtech or not for time-poor leaders<\/li>\n<li>a new, free to download app has been designed for the show, which has an AI-powered function so that visitors can search and find like-minded visitors and request meetings: it works by giving you recommendations based on your search criteria, and can put meeting requests to other relevant users of the app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">You can find a little more detail about those items here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bettshow.com\/whats-on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.bettshow.com\/whats-on<\/a><br \/>\nThe confirmed agenda so far here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bettshow.com\/bett-seminar-programme-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.bettshow.com\/bett-seminar-programme-2019<\/a><br \/>\nThis will be added to as the speaker agreements get finalised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The exhibitor list is here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bettshow.com\/bett-suppliers-list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.bettshow.com\/bett-suppliers-list<\/a><br \/>\nNote once on this page you can click on \u2018Filters\u2019 to search exhibitors by sector, product type, or for those interested in exporting (we have many overseas visitors), the regions to which they export.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #9e152c;\">What&#8217;s on at BETT19?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">A range of Higher Education suppliers will be showcasing their latest products across four days at Bett 2019, offering visitors the opportunity to touch, test and evaluate vital resources.
