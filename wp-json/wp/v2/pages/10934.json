Associates\u2019 R&amp;D can benefit from the professional experience and expertise of its member educators in two main ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>by drawing on the experience and expertise of the MirandaNet Fellowship in designing and carrying out research and evaluation;<\/li>\n<li>by drawing on the practitioner expertise of the MirandaNet Fellowship in teaching and education across all phases of education and across a range of of national contexts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Taken together these two aspects form the basic design of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Action_research\">Action Research<\/a>, a key model for understanding the value and effectiveness of tools, resources and practices in educational settings. Action Research is a model favoured by MirandaNet for its flexibility in addressing a variety of goals and situations.<\/p>\n<p>The outcomes of all collaborative work are published on MirandaNet as part of its growing library of relevant content.\u00a0 Associates may also publish their own independent reports to the MirandaNet Fellowship. All such work is publicised through the MirandaLink network and through the fortnightly MirandaLink newsletter. The debate and comment arising from the various channels open to MirandaNet members and Associates provides healthy and constructive feedback to Associates and members alike.<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0;\">\n<hr style=\"border: 1px dotted #a0182e;\" \/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 100px !important; margin-right: 100px !important; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"\/about-associates\/current-mirandanet-associates\/\">List of Current MirandaNet Associates<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13pt; margin-left: 100px !important; margin-right: 100px !important; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"\/about-associates\/associates-research\/\">Current research carried out by MirandaNet Associates and Researchers<\/a><\/p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px dotted #a0182e;\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div id=\"x-section-2\" class=\"x-section\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0 0px;  background-color: transparent;\" ><div id=\"\" class=\"x-container   max width\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; padding: 0px; \" ><div  class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-1\" style=\"padding: 0px; \" >\u00a0<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-10934","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","no-post-thumbnail"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10934"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10934"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10934\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12017,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10934\/revisions\/12017"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10934"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
