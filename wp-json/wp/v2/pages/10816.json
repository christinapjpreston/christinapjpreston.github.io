I have trained a lot of teachers around the country in the past 18 months and a common issue that I find is that a lot of them like the tablets but they tend to just use it for email and Internet browsing. The key is trying to get them past this and that is normally unlocked by finding them a useful app or feature or something that is simple to do that instantly makes a change to the way that the children can learn or find out things for themselves. <span style=\"font-size: 1.1em;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/about-associates\/associates-research\/tablet-academy-research-page\/\"> More&#8230;<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px dotted #93152c;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Three cases for education technology across the curriculum: inspiring tomorrow\u2019s leaders of creativity; improving reading standards using e-readers; moving from a Computing to a Digital Media curriculum Inspiring tomorrow\u2019s leaders of creativity Staff, pupils and parents at Ormiston Maritime Academy, &#8230; <\/p>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/about-associates\/associates-research\/\" class=\"more-link\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":10934,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-10816","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","no-post-thumbnail"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10816"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10816"}],"version-history":[{"count":29,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10816\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12672,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10816\/revisions\/12672"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10934"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10816"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
