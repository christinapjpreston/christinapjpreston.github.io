Participants are seen as equals, regardless of status, culture and nationality.\n\nThe unconference mode of informal learning has recently been modified by professional educators from the MirandaNet Fellowship into a version called a <strong>MirandaMod<\/strong>. In these events a wide range of education professionals choose a theme for a face-to-face meeting but others join in across national boundaries using a range of such digital communications technologies as video conferencing, microblogging and collaborative concept maps that emphasise the social element of learning.\n\nThe design of MirandaMods are a&nbsp;key element of MirandaNet professional knowledge sharing activity and owes much to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.virtuallearning.org.uk\/\">Dr John Cuthell<\/a> who developed this aspect of MirandaNet Fellowship activity. (For his overall contributions to the life of the MirandaNet community John was awarded a MirandaNet Lifelong Achievement award.)\n\nDates of any future&nbsp;MirandaMods&nbsp;will be published in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/events\/\">MirandaNet Events Diary<\/a>&nbsp;along with other forthcoming activities and events.\n<div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0;\">\n\n<hr style=\"border: 1px dotted #a0182e;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; margin-left: 100px !important; margin-right: 100px !important; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/mirandamods\/\">Follow this link to the MirandaMod page on the original MirandaNet site.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; margin-left: 100px !important; margin-right: 100px !important; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/events-2\/notes-for-participants-march-1st\/\">See also this page &#8220;How to participate in an unconference&#8221;.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<hr style=\"border: 1px dotted #a0182e;\">\n\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An unconference is a participant driven meeting, an informal conference among peer professionals who come together to set their agenda and determine the format and content of their conference, rather than having to accept the more formal agenda of traditional &#8230; <\/p>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/what-is-a-mirandamod\/\" class=\"more-link\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-11921","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","no-post-thumbnail"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/11921"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=11921"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/11921\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12028,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/11921\/revisions\/12028"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11921"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
