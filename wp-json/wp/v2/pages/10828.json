Why EdTech needs a critical update<\/h5>\n<p>The executive summary begins: Today, there are more computers in schools than ever before. For decades, governments around the world have invested in ICT and EdTech. However, there is still little to no evidence that learning technologies have had a positive impact on learning outcomes at the national level. As a sector, EdTech is still struggling to make its mark on education systems. However, experts who spoke to the Atlantis Group for this report can also point to success stories in classrooms around the world. <a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ag-system-failure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the report here.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n<h5>ECatalysts: The Cultural Levers of Growth in the Digital Age &#8211; A Global Research Report<\/h5>\n<p>From the executive summary: Managing organizational culture to drive digital transformation is no easy task.
