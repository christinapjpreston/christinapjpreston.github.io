Our research presents findings from a preliminary evaluation study into the effectiveness of a novel whole-class <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-7684 alignright\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Meemo.png\" alt=\"Meemo\" width=\"108\" height=\"87\">programme to increase children\u2019s working memory capacity. The programme involved pairs of children engaging in a series of five different card-based working memory activities in a mainstream primary school classroom for fifteen minutes a day, over a six-week training period. Measures of children\u2019s working memory demonstrated significant gains in working memory and verbal short-term memory. These improvements were significant at both post intervention and at two month follow up. The demonstration of a practical and effective whole class working memory training programme holds considerable potential to increase children\u2019s capacity to learn and achieve.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-size: 13pt;\"><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Skelton-Atkinson-SPI-2015.pdf\" rel=\"\">Research Paper: Increasing Children\u2019s Working Memory Capacity In Schools (Manuscript Draft 2016)<\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 13pt;\"><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/26291-MEEMO-Case-Study-Marlborough-Road-V4-LR_RGB-for-web.pdf\">Case Study: Marlborough Road Academy, Salford, Manchester<\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 13pt;\">C<a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/26429-MeeMo-Case-Study-Impact-Report_Hayes-Primary.pdf\">ase Study: Hayes Primary School, Bromley, London<\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 13pt;\"><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/MeeMo-Y3-4-summary-_Henwick-23072015.pdf\">Case Study: Henwick Primary School, Greenwich, London<\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 13pt; padding-top: 10px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.risingstars-uk.com\/Series\/MeeMo\">Meemo Pages on Rising Stars Website<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Developing Working Memory with Meemo Working memory, particularly verbal working memory, has long been recognised as foundational to children\u2019s ability to learn.
