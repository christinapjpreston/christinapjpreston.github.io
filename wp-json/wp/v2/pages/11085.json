We have based our views on wide and valuable experience of educators who responded to our preliminary survey from two professional organisations, Naace and the MirandaNet Fellowship, as well some schools. The results indicate how many issues are still to be resolved and identifies areas for urgent research, and so we conclude, not with answers, with more research questions.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p>This article was first published in the 2017 summer edition of the Naace Advancing Education Journal edited by Christina Preston.
