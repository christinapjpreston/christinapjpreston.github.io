The tools have won many internationally recognised awards including the 2017 BETT award for best tool for teaching, learning and assessment.<\/p>\n<p>Our software designers have been creating educational software since 1994 and we are passionate about bringing the best technology into education in forms that are easy yet powerful. Just2easy produces flexible software tools that allow children to be truly creative whilst they learn and enable teachers to focus on teaching and learning rather than on the software. We pride ourselves on the excellent relationships we have with our schools. Teachers using our products in the classroom often give us ideas to improve and enhance our software, input which we value greatly.<\/p>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8543 size-medium\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/IMG_27042017_130339_0-300x207.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"207\"><\/h4>\n<h4>Overview of Tool Suite<\/h4>\n<p>The Just2easy Tool Suite is a collection of online educational tools specifically designed to engage, motivate, and inspire pupils to meet and exceed many elements of the National Curriculum.<\/p>\n<p>The Tool Suite encourages pupils from Foundation Stage through to Key Stage 3 to create, share, and safely blog work at school and at home. It is also an effective resource for teachers, enabling file sharing, collaborative learning, and assessment and tracking.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/just2easy.com\/products\/j2launch\/\">J2launch <\/a>is the landing page for the tools enabling management, distribution and sharing of any digital resource.<br \/>\nThe \u2018my files\u2019 area gives teachers and pupils a dedicated space to upload work from tablets, phones, and laptops.
