Providing bespoke solutions, developed to meet the exact IT requirements of each school, the Company works to gain a deep understanding of the unique educational needs and goals of each school. This approach does not revolve around just selling the customer a product to meet their immediate needs, but aims to support the school\u2019s development over a period of time. Gaia works with clients to address wider IT vision and to ensure that all support and maintenance needs are met.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014 Gaia launched its\u00a0<strong>CPD and Training service<\/strong>, through which it works to deliver strategic consultancy, training events and project-based professional learning.
