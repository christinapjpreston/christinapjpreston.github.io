Subsequently, her career in proofreading, copy editing and copy writing began at Future Entrepreneurs (a former leading educational publisher in South Africa), where she specialised in the creation and development of print and e-learning materials for South African schools. In 2008, three of the textbooks she had co-written were included in the National Department of Education\u2019s textbook catalogue. Over the years, she has proofread and copy edited hundreds of academic articles, dissertations, theses, and novels. <\/p>\n<p>She is also passionate about research and has conducted studies on the history of the Observatory Theatre (master\u2019s mini-dissertation), the use of drama strategies for outcomes-based education in the poetry classroom (PhD thesis), and academic resilience among masters degree students in applied psychology (B. Psych (Hons)).  <\/p>\n<p>From 2012 to 2017, she taught English, Creative Arts, and Life Orientation at St Martin\u2019s\/Curro and St Andrew\u2019s School in Bloemfontein, where she also directed and produced a number of theatre productions.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, Wendy joined The Write Site (Unit for Language Development) at the University of the Free State, South Africa, as an academic writing consultant. Apart from assisting individual under- and post-graduate students with their academic writing in collaboration with their subject lecturers, this role also entailed preparing and delivering face-to-face and online academic writing workshops with specific student cohorts from various faculties. Furthermore, she presented academic literacy courses in the Higher Certificate qualification, extended degrees, and mainstream programmes. During this time, she was also approached by the University of Groningen and Amsterdam University Press to proofread and copy edit academic articles for inclusion in The Key Debates series. <\/p>\n<p>In August 2020, Wendy relocated to the UK, where she hopes to continue her work as an academic writing consultant, proofreader, copy editor, copy writer and researcher.   <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7197 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/RMrosette.png\" alt=\"Rosette\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"><\/p>\n<h4>Dai Thomas<\/h4>\n<div style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"border-radius: 9%; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; border: 2PX #9e152c SOLID;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/mr-d-thomas2015.jpg\" alt=\"Dai Thomas\" width=\"140\" height=\"122\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dai Thomas<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Dai Thomas has been working in education for 30 years. Over this time he has seen education technology develop exponentially. From his initial uses of the BBC Micro with children using a programming language called &#8220;Robol&#8221; to solve robotic arm Tea &amp; Biscuit dunking problems to running a very large Digital One to One scheme using iPads ( 1700 devices).<\/p>\n<p>Dai has worked in many schools over this period mostly in the South of England and also has further experience working in the Caribbean as a class teacher in a state school. Advisory and consultancy roles have been part of his journey ranging from working as a school cluster facilitator for 14-19 technology based educational projects, advisory work with Mirandanet to the South African Government, lecturing on ITE at Brighton University, facilitating groups on comparative education with Sri Lanka&#8217;s NIE at Sussex University.<\/p>\n<p>Dai&#8217;s research interests range over developing online tools to engage deeper learning, Interactive white board technology and visual learning, developing communities of practice with teachers and teacher CPD using e-learning. This culminated in Dai gaining his master\u2019s degree in Knowledge &amp; Learning Technology. He speaks at various events throughout the UK including local education conferences, Institute of Education (London University) Workshops, University of Sussex ITE subject lectures, University of Hull impact of Technology workshops, SEGfL Roadshows, NAACE National Conference.<\/p>\n<p>Dai currently works as the Director of Digital Services &amp; E-learning at Sussex Learning trust and spends over 30% of his time classroom teaching.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7197 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/RMrosette.png\" alt=\"Rosette\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"><\/p>\n<h4>Dr. Carsten Trinitis<\/h4>\n<div style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"border-radius: 9%; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; border: 2PX #9e152c SOLID;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/ct04.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Carsten Trinitis\" width=\"140\" height=\"122\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr. Carsten Trinitis<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Since 2011, Dr. Carsten Trinitis, has been a member of MirandaNet, an international community of professional educators in digital education and is now a Senior Fellow.
