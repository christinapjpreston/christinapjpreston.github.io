After a discussion about different kinds of change and the importance of building local capacity to deliver, the paper outlines a procurement model based on four steps: (i) define the purpose of the procurement; (ii) create a functional specification; (iii) plan the change management; and (iv) the final step, draw up a technical specification.<\/p>\n<p>While this paper will be of interest to schools and other educational establishments, it will be most applicable to local governments, national agencies and Ministries of Education where large procurement projects have rarely resulted in optimum outcomes.
