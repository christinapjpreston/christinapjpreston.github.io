It\u2019s influence has been growing in the UK since the 1970s and accelerated by the \u2018austerity\u2019 agenda \u2013 rolling back the state, increasing the role of markets, privatising public services, increasing personal choice. In education, amongst other things, \u00a0we see it in the promotion of academies and free schools, establishments outside of the structure of the local authority, designed to create surplus pupil places and thus stimulate a market between schools.<\/p>\n<p>It is an idea that, like a virus, has infected not just our commercial and public service structures, but our attitudes and approaches to our professional and working lives. It is a GERM, a Global Education Reform Movement, that has monetized education, at every level, making it a product to be sold rather than a developmental experience to be had.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst ostensibly promoting decentralisation and innovation its reliance on set metrics for judgement and evaluation drives all providers \u2013 schools and universities &#8211;\u00a0 down a narrow channel, limiting their offer, and their worth to what can be easily measured, and thereby valued.<\/p>\n<p>It is the sort of approach that technology can be conscripted to support through data collection and analysis that demonstrates achievement against pre-determined outcomes, but that is blind to incidental learning and personal development along the way. As Hayler makes clear when quoting a Master\u2019s account of discussions with a head teacher about why his year 6 SATs results were not as good as colleagues\u2019, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t use that excuse anymore,\u201d when pointing out the degree of learning difficulties in the class. The discussion ignored the progress in learners\u2019 \u00a0\u201cgrowing confidence, motivation and enthusiasm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But, this book suggests, it doesn\u2019t have to be like it, and all of us in education, wherever we are and whatever we do, can do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>So, you could also see this book as a call to arms, denouncing the appropriation of a fundamental human activity \u2013 learning &#8211; for narrow, selfish, financial, gains. By shedding light on the penetration of Neoliberal approaches into all aspects of our lives, but especially our schools, colleges and universities, it seeks to alert us to the dangers, and to our own collusion in its growth, \u00a0and asks us to not only to resist, but to push back.<\/p>\n<p>The infiltration and acceptance of Neoliberalism is shown to be an international issue, with examples from Nepal, Norway and Ireland. Sugrue uses the latter as a case study \u2013 its growth as the Celtic Tiger then its near financial collapse following the 2008 banking crisis &#8211; to demonstrate how policies of austerity and economic imperatives are used to make the case for practices that strip creativity from the curriculum to give a narrow focus on \u201cbasics,\u201d policies that \u201cget under the skin of teachers and learners where they sap vital energy, commitment, motivation and morale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are reminders that other approaches are possible. Schostak writes about the principles of co-operative education and a curriculum developed through \u201cmotivations, curiosities and interests aroused by exploring together,\u201d rather than one \u201cimposed by authorities over the needs and interests of young people and adults.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Deborah Philips, in a thoroughly researched chapter, lays bare the sneaking privatisation of schools, the blurring of the distinction between public and private interests that allows commercial organisations connected to the charitable trusts replacing local authorities as organisational entities across England, to mop up lucrative contracts. With mechanisms of local accountability disassembled in order to allow market forces to operate.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Stephen O\u2019Brien decries our ready adoption of reductionist practices and associated language embodied in our use of \u2018Learning Outcomes,\u2019 that these \u201crepresent a particular knowledge type,\u201d one that allows us to, \u201cmeasure it, claim ownership over it, test it for inadequacies.\u201d This approach shifts the focus of learning from personal interest and development to the generation of data. Instead he urges \u201cResistance for Freedoms Sake,\u201d with a call to rediscover education\u2019s \u201cmore authentic soul.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The editors offer us a framework for educational research of Five Rs \u2013 remembering, regression, reconceptualization, refraction, and renewal \u2013 but ask us also to look for instances of <em>resistance<\/em> (their italics). Their conclusion, however, is that the basis of such resistance is not based on analysis, on the narrow, data driven, reductive approach of Neoliberalism, but rather of humanity: in \u201c\u2019the question of the meaning of life\u2019\u201d which \u201ccontinues to elude the neo-liberal market society,\u201d which has \u201cfailed to win \u2018hearts and minds.\u2019\u201d In refusing to accept the de-humanising approach to education implicit in Neoliberalism we can \u201cbegin a \u2018long march\u2019 in the opposite direction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An unashamedly polemic book, who\u2019s perspective can help all of us, regardless of our own position, to reflect on, re-examine, and understand education systems globally, and our opportunities to influence their future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Negotiating Neoliberalism: Developing Alternative Educational Visions\u00a0 Tim Rudd and Ivor F.
