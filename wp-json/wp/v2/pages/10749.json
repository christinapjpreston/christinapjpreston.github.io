Evidence shows that the majority of parents want to be more involved in their children\u2019s education, but not all parents think that this is easy. It has long been accepted that parents\u2019 engagement in their children\u2019s learning at all stages is one of the most important factors in the success of a child at school. It also influences parents\u2019 own relationships to learning and wider learning in the family. When used effectively, technology makes a vital contribution to learning, teaching and management. It also supports effective communication across and beyond the school. Parents can be kept informed about key areas of their child\u2019s development and education. This helps them engage positively with their children\u2019s learning and allows them to have more information available to them to help in constructive ways. Schools can also work with parents to manage continuity of learning during transitions and school closures.

The aim is to bring about a step change in the way technology is used across education and skills. Harnessing Technology is supported by the Harnessing Technology Grant \u2013 Standards Fund investment for schools totalling \u00a3639.5 million over three years, 2008 to 2011. This capital grant represents one source of funding for technology. Other sources of technology funding, particularly for recurring costs, are outlined below. Where technology is used well, evidence demonstrates that significant benefits for learners can be achieved. The Harnessing Technology Grant represents an important investment grant to support developments that will benefit all learners. However, delivering better outcomes by using technology to improve services requires determined and co-ordinated approaches at school, local and national levels, and local authorities have an important role to play. On 3 March 2009 Becta published its Harnessing Technology implementation plan for children, schools and families. This outlines specific goals and priorities for the sector and identifies actions that national and intermediary partners will together work to deliver in order to support change.<\/td><td class=\"column-3\"><a href='\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/ht_funding_las.pdf'\/>Harnessing Technology funding 2009\u201310: Guidance for local authorities<\/a><\/td><td class=\"column-4\">ICT, Technology, Funding, Local Authorities, eSafety, Parents<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-43 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">2009<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">Improving your school through technology enables learners to:<br \/>\n\u2022 engage in a wider range of learning experiences; \u2022 learn at a pace and time to suit their needs; \u2022 benefit from improved teaching approaches; \u2022 access information and learning; esources safely and securely; \u2022 involve their parents and carers in their education; \u2022 extend learning beyond the classroom.<\/td><td class=\"column-3\"><a href='\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/improve_your_school.pdf'\/>Improve your school: How are you enabling Next Generation Learning?<\/a><\/td><td class=\"column-4\">ICT, Technology, Next Generation Learning, Teaching and Learning, Leadership, Self-Review Framework, Parents<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-44 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">2009<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">This is the second in the series of publications in which Becta highlights significant issues surrounding the uses of technology for people working in FE and Skills.

One message comes through strongly: only if leaders show an interest will others follow. Change is challenging and people need good reasons to pursue it.

Schools and local authorities are required to make all of their purchases in accordance with public procurement regulations and best value principles.

Publication of the e-strategy (DfES 2005) marked a step change in government thinking about the importance of educational technology, and ICT is now regarded as a basic educational utility rather than as an additional service.

As with previous reports in the series, it supports the case that ICT can help to improve teaching and learning in our schools. This report focuses in particular on the quality of the opportunities to learn with ICT provided to pupils, and whether there is any link to improved standards. The evidence from this study suggests that ICT should be regarded as central to the effort to improve standards, and that those schools which have been able to provide good opportunities to learn with ICT have benefited in terms of pupil attainment, motivation and attendance.<\/td><td class=\"column-3\"><a href='\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/secondary_schools_standards_full.pdf'\/>Secondary Schools \u2013 ICT and Standards: An analysis of national data from Ofsted and QCA by Becta<\/a><\/td><td class=\"column-4\">ICT, technology, Secondary, Leadership, STEM, Teaching and Learning, VLE, Collaboration, Parents, Professional Practice, Inclusion<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-273 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">2003<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">The role of the teacher is paramount in raising standards in science.When ICT is used as a demonstration tool it allows teachers to: \u2022 show scientific concepts and models; \u2022 explain and ask questions; \u2022 stimulate discussion; \u2022 invite interpretations of what is displayed; \u2022 encourage individuals to give a response, explanation or make a prediction.<\/td><td class=\"column-3\"><a href='\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/wbr.sec_science.pdf'\/>Using web-based resources in Secondary Science<\/a><\/td><td class=\"column-4\">ICT, Technology, Secondary, Teaching and Learning, Visual Learning, VLE<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-274 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">2003<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">The internet has greatly increased the sources available for history teaching in secondary schools.Web-based resources can be used online or offline or, where copyright permits, as print-outs for class or homework.The examples given here cover a range of possible activities in which ICT is used effectively in different ways.

Instead they encourage teachers to use generic software such as word processors and data-handling programs when relevant to lesson objectives.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nUsing internet-based resources need not be a stand-alone activity. Pupils need to see the internet as only one of a range of sources of information, and should be encouraged to compare and combine findings from books, pictures and other media as well as internet sites. Internet searches can be used in combination with other software such as word processors to help pupils to construct historical arguments in which the web resources are used to illustrate a point.

When considering the impact of ICT in education there often tends to be a focus on whether, and to what extent, ICT can raise pupil achievement; although this is an important aspect and a measure of a school\u2019s performance, there are many other factors which can reflect the extent to which a school is improving. The purpose of this briefing is to identify the ways in which ICT can assist with all of these factors, including: \u25cf raising pupil motivation; \u25cf improving pupil behaviour; \u25cf enhancing communications both within and between schools; \u25cf enhancing assessment methods and their impact; \u25cf reducing teacher workload; \u25cf increasing efficiency in school management.<\/td><td class=\"column-3\"><a href='\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/wtrs_ws_improvement.pdf'\/>What the research says about ICT and whole-school improvement<\/a><\/td><td class=\"column-4\">ICT, Technology, Professional Practice, VLE, Communities, Collaboration, Teaching and Learning, Assessment, MIS, Parents<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-277 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">2003<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">The BBC digital curriculum service will provide a multimedia online resource, consisting of content and a limited learning platform.
