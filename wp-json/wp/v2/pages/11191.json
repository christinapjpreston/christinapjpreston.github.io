As a result too many of our children are not receiving adequate education in computer science, information technology and digital literacy to prepare them for life\u2019s challenges. <\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.itte.org.uk\/\">Information Technology and Teacher Education Association<\/a>, (ITTE founded in 1986) agreed to continue their long term partnership with the MirandaNet  Fellowship (founded in 1992) under the new name Technology, Pedagogy and Education Association (TPEA). This restructured learned society, to be formally launched in 2019, aims to continue the work of the partners in influencing policy and practice in education technology. The TPEA name was chosen to align with ITTE\u2019s well established international journal, Technology, Pedagogy and Education (https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/toc\/rtpe20\/current) published by Taylor Francis, and one of the top-ranked international journals in educational research. Together the two organisations publish widely in professional journals, newsletters and in the education press and write most of the standard course books used in teacher education published by Routledge. <\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>You will be hearing more but this will not affect your membership of MirandaNet and your access to the information we share. <\/p><hr style=\"color: #9e152c; border-top: dotted 1px;\" \/>\r\n\u2003\r\n<h5>Influencing policy and practice in digital education<\/h5>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 13pt;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Professor Christina Preston, Chair of ITTE and founder of MirandaNet, about the history of our professional influence in policy and practice from the 1980s up to the current day.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Professional organisations stem from the tradition of medieval Trade Guilds and are still going strong. Wikipedia informs us that a guild is an association of artisans or merchants who oversee the practice of their craft\/trade in a particular area. The earliest types of guild formed as confraternities of tradesmen. They were organised in a manner something between a professional association, a trade union, a cartel, and a secret society.   <a href=\"http:\/\/u3e.55d.mywebsitetransfer.com\/influencing-policy-and-practice-in-digital-education\/\">Read the complete article here.<\/a><\/p><\/div><hr style=\"color: #9e152c; border-top: dotted 1px;\" \/>\r\n\u2003\r\n\r\n<h5>MirandaNet extends its social media reach <\/h5>\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.7em; font-size: 11pt;\">MirandaNet is experimenting with a range of social media to increase engagement with our organisation.
