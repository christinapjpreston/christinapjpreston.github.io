Cox (Co-Founder of Edusummits)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>During the writing of the International Handbook for Information Technology in Primary and Secondary Education in 2008 by Springer, the 18 Section Editors considered ways in which the reported research which would be published in the handbook might also reach policy makers and practitioners. Everyone agreed at the final editors\u2019 meeting in Paris in 2007 that a follow-on World Summit bringing together researchers, practitioners and policy makers could help broaden the global impact of the International handbook and reduce the usual risk of policy makers and practitioners \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019. A group of the editors formed a founding committee which organised the first Edusummit2009\u00a0held in The Hague in The Netherlands in June 2009. 70 leading researchers, policy makers and practitioners, working in groups, defined action steps for policy makers building on the work published in the Handbook on ICT in Primary and Secondary Education.<br \/>\n \u00a0<br \/>\n Since that first Edusummit, there have now been 4 subsequent summits in Paris (2011), Washington (2013), Bangkok (2015) and recently in Borovets. Bulgaria in September 2017. Several ITTE members have been regular contributors to these Edusummits and other members might be interested in contributing to the next one to be held in Quebec in September 2019. Meanwhile many of the working group papers will be of interest to ITTE members such as the Ebook produced by Edusummit2015 entitled\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/itte.us11.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=56c1a7f2f8dce208ccc2a81fd&amp;id=ffa921e627&amp;e=e1af5e3670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=https:\/\/itte.us11.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u%3D56c1a7f2f8dce208ccc2a81fd%26id%3Dffa921e627%26e%3De1af5e3670&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1512825254606000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFW7qoSjvZzKEvATyRp0KXoq7qAew\">Technology Advanced Quality Learning For All<\/a>\u00a0with articles from all nine working groups including\u00a0\u201cAdvancing mobile learning in formal and informal settings\u201d; \u201cProfessional development for policy makers, school leaders and teachers\u201d; &#8220;Addressing gaps and promoting educational equity\u201d; \u201cAssessment as, for and of Learning\u201d and &#8220;Advancing understanding of the roles of CS\/Informatics in the curriculum\u201d led by ITTE members Dr. Mary Webb and Prof. Margaret Cox.<br \/>\n \u00a0<br \/>\n Even the Edusummit steering committee manages to take a break sometimes.

Learning technologies should support curriculum in ways that are not otherwise possible. Rather than focusing on the technology, learning activities should meet instructional goals and involve technology when it enhances the learning. Often teachers conceptualize integration as technological rather than primarily as curricular (Hutchison &amp; Reinking, 2011). However, the focus should be on the learning and the curriculum, not the technology.\u201d<br \/>\n \u00a0<br \/>\n ITTE members who feel that these numerous and\u00a0well substantiated reports might support their ITT\u00a0work, research or\u00a0PhD supervision can find all the reports of the five EDusummits as well as download individual chapters of the 1<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0Edition of the International Handbook from\u00a0the Web. The 2<sup>nd<\/sup>\u00a0edition is currently being written and will be published in 2019.
