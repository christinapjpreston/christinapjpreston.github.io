The second edition in September 2024 will explore where edtech could develop in the opinion of the professionals who have contributed to the research. Both editions will also be the opinions of well-known experts in the field. <\/p>\n<p>The context of these ambitious journal editions is the research being undertaken by TPEA and Naace. The members of these  two professional organisations are  educators specialising in edtech. Each organisation is  conducting a major research campaign to be repeated yearly into different aspects of edtech in schools. The Naace research looks at edtech from the point of view of school management: the TPEA research looks at the curriculum from the point of view of the teacher. <\/p>\n<p>\nEach report is expected to provide the government with an up-to-date picture of edtech in schools from two different perspectives. In this way government policies can be adjusted to the needs of pupils and their teachers as the years progress. <\/p>\n<p>Educators with an interest in edtech are invited to reply to whichever research suits them best, or to both. Please invite your colleagues to contribute to this important piece of work which will be repeated annually. <\/p>\n<h6>The research surveys<\/h6>\n<p><strong>The UK edtech curriculum:<\/strong> you can access the TPEA survey of the edtech curriculum here; <a href=\"https:\/\/app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk\/s\/northampton\/computing-curriculum-survey\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk\/s\/northampton\/computing-curriculum-survey<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>EdTech: Where are we now?<\/strong> This Naace research aims to benchmark how ready our schools are to enable improvement using technology across the 6 EdTech Elements; School Management, Teaching and Learning, Digital Safeguarding and more.
