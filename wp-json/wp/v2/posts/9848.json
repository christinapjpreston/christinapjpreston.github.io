My interest in e-learning arose through personal experiences in providing \u2018traditional\u2019 (face-to-face) CPD for teachers over a number of years when I questioned the extent to which my provision had any lasting or deep impact on teachers\u2019 thinking and practice. E-learning offered a new means of supporting teachers in CPD.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This study was conducted within a collaborative e-learning project. There is seldom agreement in what is meant by the word \u2018collaboration\u2019 (Dillenbourg, 1999) though in respect of this study not only were there collaborative discussions, some teachers joined the project with a colleague, allowing involvement of pairs to be evaluated. Additionally two of us collaborated as joint project leaders sharing the management of this project and co-facilitating discussions, although each of us focused on different aspects for research: this aspect of collaboration is not explored within the context of this study.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Totten et al and Gokhal argue that shared learning helps learners to be responsible for their own learning: through doing so they become critical thinkers, analysing, synthesising and evaluating concepts (Totten, Sills, Digby &amp; Russ, 1991; Gokhale 1995).<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The context for discussion focused on an innovative and extensive, evidence-based research study we had conducted, into children\u2019s mathematical graphics (3 \u2013 8 years) (Worthington &amp; Carruthers, 2003). The online forum allowed teachers to develop their understanding about this aspect of children\u2019s development and pedagogy whilst simultaneously developing their own practice. This would allow e-learning to be embedded, an aspect emphasised in the government\u2019s e-learning consultation document (DfES, 2003a).<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Teachers elected to participate in this online community of practice, an additional and significant factor which may also have contributed to its success (unexplored in the context of this study). Many teachers explained their interest in the content of the online discussions as a specific reason for choosing to participate. It is also important to note that teachers recruited for this project were committed, enthusiastic and generally highly motivated: most also teach in Early Excellence Centres.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The literature critique explores aspects of dialogue, context and technologies through a focus on the work of Bakhtin; Mercer; Kress and Nardi and Day. These are significant themes and provide a context for the forum explored within this study. The findings indicate that the dialogical context can be enriched with the use of e-graphics when they are contributed by the participants in the forum and are sourced from the children in participants\u2019 own classrooms.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This study therefore may be said to be a search for what Habermas defines as an \u2018ideal speech situation\u2019 in which dialogue is unfettered and free of distortion (Habermas, 1984). The extent to which an \u2018ideal speech situation\u2019 has been achieved points to an \u2018information ecology\u2019 (Nardi &amp; Day, 1999) supporting positive outcomes for teachers\u2019 professional development. Analysis of the dialogue through \u2018cohesive ties\u2019 techniques (Stokoe, 1996), highlights rich language use and collaborative meaning-making. Analysis of transcripts of telephone interviews emphasises the extent of teachers\u2019 meta-cognitive concerns and is a significant indicator of deepening levels of learning through this means of CPD. Woven through the study, questions concerning teachers\u2019 views about joining the project in pairs (with a colleague) led to a number positive outcomes. There are also indicators of impact on teachers\u2019 own practice during the short duration of the project (summer term 2003) which extended to some other colleagues: these findings suggest significant benefits for teachers who are involved in CPD through e-learning. As a consequence of their involvement, the Early Years teachers in this project also reported increased confidence and enthusiasm about their own use of ICT.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Author:\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Maulfry Worthington<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Publication Date:<\/strong>\u00a02004<\/p>\n<p><em>[s2If !is_user_logged_in()]<\/em><em><mark  class=\"x-highlight\" >More&#8230; <\/mark>To see the complete Case Study, please Login or <a title=\"My Membership Options Page\" href=\"\/membership-options-page\/\">Join<\/a>.<\/em><em>[\/s2If]<\/em><\/p>\n[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]\n[s2If is_user_logged_in()]\n<p><strong>Introduction: the efacilitation context <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of this study I have the term \u2018collaboration\u2019 to refer to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Teachers learning through shared discussion within the on-line community of practice<\/li>\n<li>Teachers collaborating in pairs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I aim to treat the collaboration of pairs as a distinct issue although clearly there is some overlapping when the two aspects coincide.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Discussions took place through an online forum \u2018<a href=\"\/graphics\/\">MirandaNet Web Graphics Discussion<\/a>\u2019. A significant feature of is the use of an innovative feature whereby examples of children\u2019s work (children\u2019s original mathematical graphics and photographs of children working) are visible on the screen at the same time as the discussion threads. The concept for this feature was ours but developed through the technical expertise of MirandaNet\u2019s web manager. Of major importance is the fact that examples of children\u2019s work are from the teachers\u2019 own classes, either emailed after scanning; as digital photographs, or posted to us. These examples appear on the left of the screen on the same page as the forum, as a moving slideshow. Members of the online community are also able to click on any of these \u2018thumbnails\u2019 to enlarge them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Through their involvement teachers would also be developing their skills in ICT. Recent research into early learning shows that \u2018significant ICT training at a personal level is needed for many early years practitioners\u2019 (Moyles et al p.136, 7.51). Teachers\u2019 low level of use and initial anxieties about ICT in this study, whilst not a focus, are in marked contrast to the findings of a study by PARN (2001) which revealed a high level of internet use amongst professionals (2001, p.2). This present study may also make a small contribution to the government\u2019s targets in the \u20185 action areas\u2019 (DfES, 2003b).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cohort:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We recruited a cohort of 18 teachers, most of who teach in Early Excellence Centres throughout England, from Cumbria to the Isle of Wight:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>83% teach in under-fives settings<\/p>\n<p>11% teach in mainstream settings (Reception and R\/Y1)<\/p>\n<p>6% teach in special education (Reception)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Of these, 8 joined in <strong>pairs<\/strong> and 10 as <strong>individuals<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Teachers <em>elected <\/em>to participate in this online community of practice: we believe this may be an additional and significant factor in ensuring its success (unexplored in the context of this study).

It is also important to note that most teachers recruited for this project were committed, enthusiastic and generally highly motivated: most also teach in Early Excellence Centres<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Literature Critique<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A central theme of this study is dialogue and the way in which it supports learning. One of Bakhtin\u2019s significant legacies is his perspective on \u2018utterances\u2019 reflecting the speech of others through \u2018ventriloquation\u2019 (Bakhtin, 1981; Holquist, 1981) or \u2018multivoicedness\u2019 (Wertsch, 1991).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2018The word in language is half someone else\u2019s. It becomes \u201cone\u2019s own\u201d only when<\/p>\n<p>the speaker populates it with his own intentions, his own accent, when he<\/p>\n<p>appropriates the word, adapting it to his own semantic and expressive intention.<\/p>\n<p>(Bakhtin, 1981. pp 293-294).<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The writings of Bakhtin and Volosinov \u2013 both contempories of Vygotsky &#8211; are often referred to when using the term \u2018dialogical\u2019. In their views language originates \u2018in social interactions and struggle\u2019 (Maybin. (2003. p.64).\u00a0 Volosinov viewed meaning as \u2018realised only in the process of active, responsive understanding\u2019 between speakers, (1929\/86. p.102-3).\u00a0 This dialogic process, Wegerif argues, can lead to \u2018effective collaborative learning\u2019 (2001. p.11).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The examples of young children\u2019s \u2018written\u2019 mathematics (as e-graphics) in this present study also have a pre-history \u2013 of others\u2019 marks and written methods &#8211; and are therefore polyadic. Each representation encapsulates themes, styles and thoughts of others, whose earlier representations \u2013 like our utterances \u2013 themselves embrace features of many others\u2019 representations. Wells, (drawing on Freeman, 1995; Donald, 1991 &amp; Wartofsky, 1979) argues that \u2018because each advance in representing, the previous modes were not lost, we have a repertoire of modes to hand\u2019 (2000. p.5).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This view is significant in the context of the collaborative context of online communities, and specifically in the context of this forum. Mercer argues that \u2018language is often used in conjunction with these other meaning making tools\u2019, (i.e. gesture and drawings) \u2018which can be used to draw physical artefacts into the realm of the conversation\u2019 (Mercer, 2000. p. 23). \u2018Original\u2019 creative acts, whether speech or drawings must therefore always be regarded as integrating the creative acts of others.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Since language is \u2018not simply a system for transmitting information (but)\u2026 is a system for thinking collectively\u2019 (Mercer, 2000), p. 15), CMC offers advantages when exploring \u2018a particular complex issue\u2019 (Mercer, 2000, p. 127). It is clear that CMC must therefore offer special advantages to the educational community with its diverse and complex issues of learning and teaching.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But online communities of practice are more than dialogue between participants: the fact that the dialogue is computer-mediated contributes to the rapidly changing landscape of language and literacy. In his 2003 study Kress\u2019s approach to <em>new<\/em> literacies is challenging and thought-provoking, the affordances of the medium provide new opportunities. The role of e-facilitator is a very different role to that of \u2018teacher\u2019 or \u2018lecturer\u2019, forcing us to recognise the ways in which technology and new forms of media \u2018will produce far-reaching shifts in relations of power\u2019 (Kress, 2003, p.1). This is likely to be felt throughout education, not least in the context of CPD: the <em>expert leaders<\/em> as knowledge-giver have gone and in their places are efacilitators. As Mercer observes, \u2018like any other medium, CMC will only be as good for collective thinking as its users make it\u2019 (2000, p. 129).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mercer suggests that \u2018fluency in discourse is likely to be one of the obvious signs of membership\u2019 (Mercer, 2000, p. 106 \u2013 7). To what extent did we achieve fluency in our online discussion with teachers? The \u2018cohesive ties\u2019 analysis used in this current study (Stokoe, 1996, cited in Mercer, 2000), is, Mercer suggests, one way in which participants develop continuous lines of thought, amplifying development of shared meanings. In Bohm\u2019s view (1996) dialogue is \u2018a stream of meaning flowing among and through and between us\u2019 (p.6). The relationship between Bakhtin\u2019s \u2018ventriloquation\u2019 is clear and further emphasised in Wegerif\u2019s work on a \u2018dialogical model of reason\u2019 which is in turn supported by Lipman\u2019s philosophical \u2018community of inquiry\u2019 (1991). The listener\u2019s role is implicit and active, requiring \u2018thoughtful attention\u2019 (Fiumara, 1990). Mercer\u2019s introduction of the term \u2018interthinking\u2019 helps focus our attention on the collaborative, co-ordinated intellectual activity of language use, and its significance within the context of meaningful online dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Technologies, in particular the screen (television and computer) have now overcome the dominance of the book, leading, Kress argues, to \u2018an inversion of semiotic power\u2019 (p.9) in which the visual mode holds sway over the partial mode of writing: \u2018as a consequence, writing in no longer a full carrier either of all the meaning\u2019 (p. 21). Kress\u2019s semiotic exploration explores not only images and text on and off screen but the use of space. \u2018Reading\u2019 of the e-graphics and text on our \u2018MirandaNet Graphics Discussion\u2019 forum must subconsciously take into account these complex layers of meaning-making, for \u2018<em>the world told<\/em> is a different world to <em>the world shown\u2019<\/em> (Kress, 2003, p.1). The affordances of new technologies and the dominance of the screen will, Kress argues, \u2018have many consequences\u2019 (2003, p.166).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nardi and Day (1999) use the term <em>information ecology<\/em>; describing \u2018a system of people, practices, values and technologies in a particular local environment\u2019 (p. 49). Rather than \u2018communities of practice\u2019 (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) this term suggests something more compassionate; embracing different aspects of the social and technological that, the authors propose, \u2018co-evolve\u2019. Social practices, they argue, help shape the technologies and ultimately advocate ways to use and adapt them. In such ecologies technology need not intimidate or rule, but is reciprocal and interdependent. For Nardi and Day, there is \u2018a powerful synergy between changing tools and practices. As people become more involved\u2026 they will be able to articulate more clearly and more precisely what works and what doesn\u2019t, what they value and what they need and want\u2019 (Nardi and Day, 1999. p. 75).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Teachers in this study came with limited experience and some anxieties of ICT although all reported increased confidence in their use of ICT during the project (though this was not a focus of this study). Nardi and Day use the film <em>Metrolopolis<\/em> as a powerful metaphor for working with new technology. The changing use of technologies that allow CPD through elearning, must also ensure a \u2018new future in which the minds that plan and the hands that do the work do not live in separate worlds, but are mediated by the human heart\u2019 (Nardi &amp; Day, 1999. p. 11).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Case Study<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Data collection<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I based my study on a model of grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) which enabled me to \u2018think systematically, critically and intelligently\u2019 (Pring, 1978: p. 244-5). Responses from teachers and analysis of transcripts also allowed me to prepare an \u2018audit trail\u2019 that established a chain of evidence (Schwandt and Halpern ,1988).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Data was collected through:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>transcripts of the discussions<\/li>\n<li>questionnaires (end-point)<\/li>\n<li>telephone interviews.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transcripts of online discussions <\/strong>allowed analysis of the discussion and the number of posting from each teacher helped determine levels of involvement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Questionnaires<\/strong> on socialization were sent by email and by surface mail. 55% of questionnaires were returned completed. Rather than rely on a limited number of questionnaires I eventually used these questions as a basis for telephone interviews. This allowed me to explore issues in some depth and provided validity through responses from interviews with all project teachers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Telephone interviews<\/strong>: interviews lasted for approximately twenty minutes each.

Furthermore, teachers\u2019 high level of emphasis on metacognition (whilst probably unconscious) indicates a concern with learning about learning. One of the features of this study was the powerful context providing by both text (talk) and the visual examples: embedding teachers\u2019 e-graphics may be one factor in contributing to successful outcomes. This feature has the potential to be used in educational contexts across all subjects and all phases. Laurillard (2002) argues that \u2018educational technologies, especially new ones, demand effort and ingenuity in the development of materials, but rarely is this extended to the embedding of these materials in their education niche\u2019 (cited in Shephard, Riddy, Warren and Mathias, 2003, p.246).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cIt\u2019s great to share ideas and especially to get feedback from the graphics I put on.

More specifically participating with a colleague (pair) provided many benefits. Candy proposes that \u2018for successful partnerships, a longer-term relationship, in which trust and confidence can be built up has real advantages\u2019 (Candy, 1997, p.15). The value of pair work is exemplified by Holmes who concluded that students performed \u2018substantially better when they worked in pairs\u2019 (2003, p.256).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Wenger outlines essential features of a community of practice that combine \u2018joint enterprise, mutuality (and) developing a shared repertoire\u2019 (Wenger, 2000, p.229). As teachers discussed their practice and described children\u2019s learning, relevant \u2018stories\u2019 they told supported their apprenticeship, through which \u2018dealing with past problems is a way of thinking together\u2019 (Mercer, 2000, p. 111). Stories appear to play a major role in decision making (Jordan, 1989) with <em>personal<\/em> story telling offering \u2018tool of diagnosis and reinterpretation\u2019 (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p. 109). However, Barnett, (1997) warns that teachers need to practice critical skills and go beyond \u2018uncritical storytelling\u2019 (cited in Preston, 2003, p. 14).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Through collaborative participation, teachers moved between discussions exploring (informal) theory building and pedagogy in synergy. Drawing on Levi-Strauss\u2019s <em>bricolage <\/em>(1966), Papert argues that \u2018in the most fundamental sense, we, as learners are all bricoleurs\u2019 (1993, p. 173): this signifies that we are continually \u2018moving ideas from the concrete to the abstract and back again\u2019 (Dillon, 2003. p.1). The online socialization that Salmon so clearly outlines (2002) is recognised as significant in creating a sense of \u2018community\u2019 in which learners move from \u2018peripheral participation\u2019 toward \u2018full participation in the socio-cultural practices of a community\u2019 (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p. 29) and one in which the importance of the community\u2019s ecology is recognised (Nardi &amp; Day, 1999).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aim 3:<\/strong> <strong>the extent to which e-learning provides an effective means of professional development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My concern about the level of impact of traditional (face-to-face) CPD is shared by Feist who observes that CPD initiatives \u2018have been criticized for their failure to produce significant changes in either teaching practice or student learning\u2019 (2003, p.1). She proposes that successful e-learning is achieved through <em>learner-centred<\/em> learning (Cuban 2001; Ertmer; 1999; also Rogers, 1983).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A recent review of 17 research studies into collaborative CPD (not online) found \u2018that sustained and <em>collaborative <\/em>CPD was linked to a positive impact on teachers\u2019 classroom practice\u2019 (Rundell &amp; Seddon, 2003. p. 3). The review found that teachers\u2019 shared a stronger belief in self-efficacy and reported a high level of commitment to change. Their enthusiasm for collaborative working and professional learning had increased. Furthermore, the recognition that peer support was beneficial featured strongly in many of the studies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sorenson and Takle (2002) argue that \u2018knowledge building dialogue within the context of collaborative learning appears to be a complex challenge\u2019 (p.30); this may be in part due to the nature of a virtual environment (Scardamalia &amp; Berieter, 1996). In this study teachers\u2019 subject and pedagogical learning developed significantly, with an element of enjoyment and challenge:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been teaching for some years, most courses offer nothing new \u2013 they say the same thing, or they say the same thing in a different way. It\u2019s a very long time for me since something like this has come along. The difference with this (research) project is that it was an intellectual challenge.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(Jan, Camden).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Involvement led to impact on teachers\u2019 classroom practice that in many instances occurred earlier in the project that expected and extended beyond what we had hoped, involving other (non-project) colleagues and staff outside of their settings. None of the project teachers had previously explored the theory or practice of the content of discussions (only very recently published). However, teachers\u2019 comments during early weeks of the project indicated that they were able to relate what they were learning online to children\u2019s work and gradually explore the pedagogy to support this: in other words, to move as<em> bricoleurs<\/em>\u00a0 between emerging theories and their developing practice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is worth considering whether we are seeing a revolutionary means of learning that will ultimately replace <em>pedagogy<\/em> with <em><a href=\"#and\">andragogy<\/a>. <\/em>Connor argues that in moving towards such a model, \u2018in the information age, the implications of a move from teacher-centred to learner centred education are staggering\u2019 (1997-2003, p. 2).<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Forward to the future<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2018The challenge of educating for the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century in contrast to \u201cindustrial era\u201d education,\u2019 Roo argues \u2018is to find the best ways in which students can master a broader range of knowledge, make decisions given incomplete information and uncertain goals, manage team work and filter information rather than simply find it\u2019 (1999, p. 2). He argues that e-learning has the potential \u2018to bring the white heat of the technological revolution to education in a way that the field of educational technology has long aimed for\u2019. Nonetheless, Nardi and O\u2019Day emphasise the need to create a healthy \u2018information ecology (which) takes time to grow, just as rain forests and coral reefs do\u2019 (1999. p 58). Since the project ended (July 2003) a number of the project teachers have asked that we continue the forum in 2004, thereby acting as a further indicator of success. In this we wish to move the level of discussion into \u2018exploratory\u2019 talk (Wegerif, 2003) and invite teachers to focus on their own practice-based research projects. It is not technology alone that can drive CPD through e-learning forward, but technology used sensitively by e-facilitators to create innovative environments for learning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the lived experience of an e-facilitator is very different to that of a leader of traditional (face-to-face) professional development. Heilbron emphasises that the role of the teacher is changing: \u2018she will become a facilitator of access to information, as opposed to the guardian of bodies of knowledge to be acquired\u2019 (2000, p. 7). But it is to be hoped that e-learners will themselves generate new theories and emergent paradigms that can be \u2018mined\u2019 by others later. This will lead to a blurring of the division between CPD providers (e-facilitators) and participants, and has the potential to create shared cognition (Brown Collins &amp; Duguid, 1988; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991).\u00a0 Such a new paradigm will not, Flood believes, \u2018be one based on learning, but one based on the development of environments that facilitate learning\u2019 (Flood, no date. p. 2).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For the participants in these virtual communities of practice, this study has demonstrated that there are often unexpected gains and deep levels of learning which in turn are carried forward to the children in the teachers\u2019 own settings and classes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is hoped that this study will make a small contribution to the rapidly growing body of evidence-based research on e-learning and education and point some ways forward to the future.<\/p>\n[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]\n<p><strong>References &amp; Contacts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>None available<\/p>\n[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]\n[review]\n[\/s2If]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; [divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;] Abstract In the past online learning has often resulted in a re-creation of teachers\u2019 normal, pedagogical practices (Cooney &amp; Stephenson, 2001; Alexander &amp; Boud; 2001).
