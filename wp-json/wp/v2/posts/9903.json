They are usually held in the evening towards the end of the school week or at weekends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Author:<\/strong>\u00a0<b>MirandaNet<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em>[s2If !is_user_logged_in()]<\/em><em><mark  class=\"x-highlight\" >More&#8230; <\/mark>To see the complete Case Study, please Login or <a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"My Membership Options Page\" href=\"\/membership-options-page\/\">Join<\/a>.<\/em><em>[\/s2If]<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[s2If is_user_logged_in()]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>COST EFFECTIVE CPD \u2013 IT\u2019S POPULAR AND FREE!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>TeachMeets cost nothing for teachers or schools to put on, as all food, drink, accommodation and other publicity costs are increasingly paid for by commercial educational sponsors. The sponsors do not get to present but they do give out publicity matter and prizes for raffles. (e.g. a year\u2019s free subscription to their services).<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, as in the Blackpool Teachmeets last year, more teachers turned out for TeachMeet CPD than \u201cofficial\u201d scheduled LA CPD. This is increasingly becoming the norm \u2013 the main reasons for their popularity is that it that the CPD is coming from the teachers themselves and not the the LA advisers; the CPD is also a social event with food and drink and a chance to catch up with others on best practice. Teachers are often best placed to know more about current practice and innovative ways in which to reflect on and manage classroom teaching and learning so it is not surprising that this method of CPD has now caught on like wildfire.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MIRANDAMODS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I also film and archive MirandaMods which follow a similar pattern to TeachMeets except the films document longer and more reflective discussions.<\/p>\n<p>People will discuss face to face and remotely the issues outlined in the MirandaMod sessions but also be able to amend documents in real time online as each session progresses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CPD IN HARD TO GET TO PLACES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the main distinctions of MirandaMods over TeachMeets is that they are often broadcast from exhibitions or difficult to get to places for broadcast. I pride myself on being able to broadcast from almost anywhere in the country and with the most meagre of equipment. Last year I even managed to broadcast an educational discussion from a treehouse in the middle of Regents Park<\/p>\n<p>Have a look at this broadcast from a table on a stand at the recent BETT show \u2013 the commercial partners, academics, teachers and others introduce themselves and the debate begins. Not only is the discussion going on face to face but also globally and all the notes and other exemplars are being gathered and sourced onto a collaboratively written document in real time saving hours of collating and dissemination.<\/p>\n<p><embed src=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/play\/gr8cgb_zegA\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"642\" height=\"386\"><\/embed><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"post-704\" class=\"post-704 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-consultancy category-courses\"><\/div>\n<div id=\"nav-below\" class=\"navigation\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[review]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[\/s2If]<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Film and teacher driven CPD.
