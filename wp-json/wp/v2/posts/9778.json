That\u2019s where Bernard\u2019s idea for wireless connectivity comes in.\u00a0 He asked for a meeting with the governors of the school to seek their approval and involve them with the project.\u00a0 They agreed and he took it from there.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Historical<\/h3>\n<p>Our school was built in the sixties and wasn\u2019t designed for computers.\u00a0 With two RM Window Box PCs in every classroom one in each room connected by cable to the Internet, it didn\u2019t seem feasible to start installing more cables with all the disruption that would cause.\u00a0 And there just wasn\u2019t the room for any more PCs in teachers\u2019 rooms.\u00a0 Bernard contacted the RM sales desk and asked to speak to someone about wireless connection and RM Notebook computers.\u00a0 There were several other companies the school could have chosen but we knew RM were dependable and experienced in the field.<\/p>\n<h3>Solution<\/h3>\n<p>With no space for a conventional ICT room, the wireless system seemed to offer the idea of taking the computers to the pupils instead.\u00a0 RM furnished us with the telephone number of one of their contracted company CONNECTIX.\u00a0 They promptly agreed to provide us with a site survey to see if there would be any problems with obstructions to the radio signal.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"transmitter\" src=\"\/membership\/uploads\/432\/bs1.jpg\" alt=\"transmitter\" width=\"451\" height=\"290\" align=\"right\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An appointment was made and their engineers arrived and demonstrated to us that the technology would work..\u00a0 I confirmed the order with RM and CONNECTIX arrived to do the job. The transceiver, a little box with two antennae was sited at a high point above and between junior classes Year5 and Year6.<\/p>\n<p>A single cable led from the transceiver to our existing hub, connecting it to the ISDN line and the telephone system.\u00a0 The radio signal was found to cover a good range, all of the junior classrooms as far as the library some 30 metres away and it even extended out into the playground.\u00a0 The next step was to call in the borough technician, Khaled, who connected the PCMCIA card to 6 laptops and installed the software.\u00a0 Soon we were logging on to the internet from our wireless notebooks.\u00a0 It was a thrill to click on RM easymail and print a document from any of the 6 notebooks to the class printer.<br \/>\nNow all we had to do was order an RM Notebus from Research Machines to securely store our notebooks and charge them up overnight for use the next day.\u00a0 Soon the notebooks were in daily use first in year 5, then year 6 and now the notebooks are shared on a weekly basis with the 4 junior classes.<br \/>\nWe have an ICT club on Tuesday after school and the wireless notebooks really are an asset here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/membership\/uploads\/432\/bs2.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pupils busy using the Internet using the wireless technology.\u00a0 You may just glimpse the intel card protruding from the notebook on the right.\u00a0 This receives and transmits the radio signal from the laptop.\u00a0 It can be removed easily when internet access is not necessary.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefits<\/h3>\n<p>With many notebooks to go around, greater access to computers and the internet has been achieved without an ICT suite.<\/p>\n<p>Notebooks are charged and ready for use each teaching session by storing them in a secure cabinet: The RM Notebus.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/membership\/uploads\/432\/bs3.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pupils have become expert at collecting storing and using the notebooks.\u00a0 Access to the internet, email etc has been greatly increased for each class.\u00a0 Pupils can log-on to the Window-Box software and access Think.com from their tables.\u00a0 The system is fully expandable.\u00a0 By adding another transceiver a bridge is created from one to another, effectively extending the system to the whole school.\u00a0 The system can also be connected to the school network\u00a0 i.e. an ICT suite.\u00a0 Standalone computers, which are not cabled in your school, can be fitted with a card to enable them too to receive the radio signal.\u00a0 The system works well and improvements to radio technology will mean it will be even more reliable in future.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243;
