In this way MirandaNet provides professional development opportunities and produces teacher-led evidence to support systemic change.<\/p>\n<p>Recent projects have involved teachers and students from \u00a0The Phoenix Academy in Croydon, Bodnant Primary School in Wales and Oakdale Juniors, London where Dawn Hallybone, a MirandNet member teaches. MirandaNet would like to identify more schools who want to be involved in research projects. In particular we have an Estonian exchange coming up comparing innovative approaches to teaching and learning in 10 schools in Estonia and the UK.<\/p>\n<p>For further information or to express an interest in MirandaNet\u00a0research projects please get in touch with\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:\/\/christina@mirandanet.ac.uk\">Christina Preston<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>MirandaNet Lifelong Achievement Awards<\/h3>\n<p><strong>MirandaNet Lifelong Achievement Awards <\/strong>have been\u00a0awarded to<strong> John Cuthell<\/strong> and <strong>Francis Howlett<\/strong> for the impact that they have had on MirandaNet practice and research over at least 15 years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Francis<\/strong> designed and maintained the original<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/\">\u00a0MirandaNet website<\/a>\u00a0 over many years using his coding skills and his extensive knowledge about accessibility.
