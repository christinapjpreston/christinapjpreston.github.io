This meeting is a good sign and even more so that we have endured a long period when academics and teachers along with other sundry experts have been collectively criticised and dismissed, frequently by our government&#8217;s own ministers and representatives.<\/p>\n<p>In this meeting Christina will be representing MirandaNet, Sarah will represent MESH and Helen, ITTE. We have a shared agenda to promote the value of professional organisations in the field of edtech and we will be talking about the challenges facing teachers in making the most of edtech:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A lack of opportunities for teachers to exchange knowledge; Access to the knowledge base of the profession;<\/li>\n<li>The reduction of university places for beginning teachers and the shortage of University-based &nbsp;Initial Teacher training (ITT);<\/li>\n<li>A lack of CPD in edtech;<\/li>\n<li>A lack of&nbsp;research into edtech;<\/li>\n<li>A shortage of funds for schools to upgrade their digital infrastructure which is&nbsp;ageing and changing;<\/li>\n<li>A growing shortage of computing teachers;<\/li>\n<li>Lack of professional contact with DfE.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The landscape has not been welcoming to professional organisations in edtech since the Coalition government in the UK took over in 2010. Sadly, for example, the much respected and long-established&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.naace.co.uk\/\">Naace<\/a> is having to close their trading arm.<\/p>\n<p>It seems a good time to present to the DfE how professional organisations can offer some cost-effective solutions to the challenges we all face, for example through participation in our &nbsp;e-communities of practice and our digital publishing. We will be explaining&nbsp;the value to the profession of MirandaNet as a practice-based research network with links to CPD funded by companies. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meshguides.org\/\">MESH<\/a> too is developing a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meshguides.org\/mesh-guides\/\">knowledge mobilisation resource<\/a> for teachers and academics&nbsp;and <a href=\"http:\/\/itte.org.uk\">ITTE<\/a>, among other activities , publishes&nbsp;a respected <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/toc\/rtpe20\/current\">peer-reviewed journa<\/a>l.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In order to make sure that the DFE gains from our experience and influence we will be suggesting that we re-establish contact with the DFE so that we can inform our members adequately about policy directions and also express our members views about policy and strategy.<\/p>\n<p>We will be inviting Bridie Tooher to speak at our Global Summit on May 4th in London and hope to see many of you there.
