Therefore, my project\u2019s aims were to investigate the viability of students\u2019 use of ICT for Modern Foreign Languages at home (including their response to their own private forum) and whether this had any impact on their attitude to language learning. In addition, I proposed to examine my own e-learning throughout the project.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Project Outline:<\/strong> The homework tasks included going onto different language websites to complete various activities, writing reviews and reports of chosen language sites and games which students would then email to me, and participating in a language forum that was set up specifically for the project on the MirandaNet site. Other questions I intended to consider include: How effectively can online homework be monitored? What effect, if any, does this e-learning project have on students\u2019 attitude to language learning? How successful was the Year 7 discussion forum and how does it differ from an adult forum?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Expected outcomes\/findings:\u00a0<\/strong> I hypothesized that students would find this new way of approaching MFL homework both useful and fun. In addition, I hoped that exposure to these language sites and the educational games and activities on them, as well as to our private forum, would encourage student autonomy by motivating students to access the sites again in their own time. A further supposition was that the project would help instill in the students a more positive attitude towards language-learning.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>For my part I expected that the project would help me reflect on the processes of practice and planning as well as exploring new ways of communicating with my students. In acting as an efacilitator on the forum I would enable students to experiment with new ways of communicating with each other online.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Data collection and analysis:<\/strong> I intended to use a variety of methods to collect and evaluate data, such as an analysis of posts to the language forum, observations, questionnaires, a log of the project, interviews with students.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Author:\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Karen Hanrahan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Publication Date:<\/strong>\u00a02004<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em>[s2If !is_user_logged_in()]<\/em><em><mark  class=\"x-highlight\" >More&#8230; <\/mark>To see the complete Case Study, please Login or <a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"My Membership Options Page\" href=\"\/membership-options-page\/\">Join<\/a>.<\/em><em>[\/s2If]<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[s2If is_user_logged_in()]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>AIMS AND INTRODUCTION<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI found it really fun because I was learning and playing games at the same time, which makes it a more interesting and fun way to learn.\u201d (Laura, Year 7 French)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My primary aim in undertaking this research project was to investigate how ICT can be used as an effective, meaningful and motivating homework tool in Modern Foreign Languages. Over the past decade ICT has revolutionized teaching and learning in secondary schools. However, much of the focus has been on improving students\u2019 IT literacy within specific IT lessons or through cross-curricular projects in school.<\/p>\n<p>According to Becta, \u201cICT has the potential to make a significant contribution to the teaching of MFL by: developing and improving all four language skills; enhancing pupils&#8217; language learning skills; helping to develop independent learning skills; providing different levels of support to match different pupils&#8217; language learning skills; communicating with people in the target language; accessing a range of resources in the target language and identifying with the people of target language communities and countries; providing a flexible and time-saving resource; allowing teachers to respond to different stages in a pupil&#8217;s writing\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.becta.org.uk\/corporate\/corporate.cfm?section=1&amp;id=2111\">http:\/\/www.becta.org.uk\/corporate\/corporate.cfm?section=1&amp;id=2111<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My objective in undertaking the GTC Action Research project was to examine students\u2019 elearning in my subject area from a slightly different perspective, namely by exploring MFL homework as an online, more autonomous, student-led learning experience.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This choice of topic was prompted essentially by two factors, the first one being the constant challenge to create meaningful homework with limited resources; in my school students are not permitted to take textbooks home and teachers are allocated a quota of one hundred photocopies per month. The lack of scope in using the IT facilities in school, for my subject area at least, constitutes the second reason for seeking an alternative way that students could get involved online in MFL.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I also wanted to consider whether the use of ICT in this way could promote a more positive attitude towards language learning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A significant part of the implementation stage was the creation of an online private language forum for the students involved in the project. This was designed as a space where they could share their experiences and knowledge, seek solutions to any problems encountered as well as being the area where they posted their homework.\u00a0 Students\u2019 response to this online forum was a further element I wished to analyse in undertaking the Action Research project.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The framework upon which my project was based is the Action Research model. While many variations on the model exist (see for example Hopkins (2002) for an exposition of different models), the theory underpinning them and their typically cyclical nature are features common to most.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/ARcycle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2757\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/ARcycle-205x300.jpg\" alt=\"ARcycle\" width=\"205\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><em><br \/>\nReflect &#8211; <\/em><\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (source: Ideas!)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I\u2019m having difficulty getting access to the IT suites in school during languagelessons.

Pupils were instructed to send their homework and any problems they encountered to this address.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Initially, the homework tasks set were of a very specific nature and I gave very detailed information about each link e.g. pupils were told to go onto a certain website and complete certain games and\/or activities and then to email the answers to me.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I was struck by the ease with which the vast majority of pupils seemed to engage with the technology. Moreover, I had anticipated a greater degree of difficulty with regard to internet access than was actually the case. Of the five students (out of 59) who I had to chase up for homework, four were often late in producing homework and needed much prompting, which led me to question whether their lack of homework was entirely due to gaining online access.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One technical problem which we did encounter at the start was with the Educationcity website; I had subscribed to a free trial on this site and therefore students needed a username and password to access the games and activities. I gave these out in a lesson but a number of students either misplaced their sheet or did not know where to enter the details on the website (it was not self-evident). Several of the emails I received related to these difficulties but once I replied to the individuals in question they managed to login and succeeded in doing the homework. The next lesson I demonstrated how to do it using my laptop in the classroom for those who were still not sure.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I found that monitoring homework was not a problem as it was easy to keep track of emails received but I was more lenient in giving extensions for completing homework as I felt that some students had genuine excuses (such as their internet connection temporarily not working etc.).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As students gained in confidence and competence the homework tasks became more open-ended e.g. they were given a choice of activity or website and then had to email me a review of a certain game or language site and two new words in the target language which they had learnt.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The emails served a dual function in that they allowed me to monitor and assess pupil homework and learning as well as providing valuable data for my research.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cThe phorum was great. You could talk to people in German without having to pronounce it right.

The forum was designed to extend online dialogue beyond that of teacher and student so that pupils could communicate online not only with those in their class but also with students in the other language group. My role was one of moderator. The positive response to the forum was beyond what I could have hoped for: there were 235 posts in all (not including those which had, for various reasons, been deleted) and the excitement and enthusiasm that it generated is, in my opinion, immeasurable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We did an initial lesson in the IT room to introduce pupils to the forum (of the 50 respondents in the questionnaire only 8 had previously been on a forum). Pupils were given definite guidelines regarding netiquette and relevance of posts. From this point students were no longer to email me but rather to post their messages and homework on the forum. Moreover, students were encouraged to try to help each other with any problems encountered.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Year 7 Online Language Project<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"100%\"><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>\u00a0Homework for German group (for week beginning 30\/06)<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"100%\">Author:\u00a0<a href=\"\/phorum\/profile.php?f=12&amp;id=17\">Miss Hanrahan<\/a><br \/>\nDate:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a006-27-03 15:28Guten Tag!Even though we will not have a lesson until next week I&#8217;m going to post your homework up now so you can get a headstart or get it done early if you wish.<\/p>\n<p>Go onto the website www.quia.com\/web.

Surprisingly i didnt actually find that hard because the numbers in german is about the only thing im that good at! The tasks that you had to do were about matching up these numbers, you had to translate german into english or vice verser.

And it did. I found that the text gives a very comprehensive account of online learning communities yet in an accessible, user-friendly style. When it came to running my own forum for the case study I found myself returning to it as it draws together very well the different theories and discussions regarding human behaviour online.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Salmon\u2019s <em>E-tivities<\/em> was another important font of knowledge for me, and from what I can gather, for other colleagues also. Her five-stage framework has been heavily referred to throughout the course, initially almost forming the backbone before it was repositioned in the second part of the course as we considered other theories and models of e-learning. The book\u2019s hands-on approach was attractive, offering an abundance of practical ideas.\u00a0 While I did find many of her ideas engaging I think a certain number are more geared to an older audience and would be difficult to implement in a secondary school context. However, it was extremely useful for our GTC efacilitation work and I found myself dipping into it throughout the course. In particular part II, the resources for practitioners, was densely packed with workable ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Still on the subject of online communities in particular, I thought that Paccagnella\u2019s article (1997) discussing strategies for exploring ethnographic research for virtual communities made for compelling reading and throws up pertinent issues regarding the complexities involved in analyzing the online world.<\/p>\n<p>In general, I found it quite difficult to find relevant articles in my subject area to help inform my thinking. One very interesting article I did come across was by Warschauer and Healey (1998). This is an excellent study of the evolution of CALL, where we are now and where we are heading in the future. They assert that in the networked society most \u2018real\u2019 writing will take place on screen and in response to this second language teachers will need to teach students effective online writing skills. The web should no longer be viewed merely as a distribution vehicle but rather as a medium in its own right: \u201cStudents will want to learn how to publish Web pages that are fitting for the multimedia environment. We will thus need to find ways to teach our students to combine a variety of media&#8211;texts, images, sounds, video&#8211;without diluting the attention we give to language\u201d. This then begs the question as to whether the MFL curriculum is addressing these needs and how we can better integrate technology into the language learning process in schools.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>References &amp; Contacts<\/h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">None available<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[review]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[\/s2If]<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How can ICT be used to set meaningful and motivating homework in MFL?
