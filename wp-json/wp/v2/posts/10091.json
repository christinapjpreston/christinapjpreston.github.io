The New Zealand Ministry of Education regulates school classroom refurbishments and defines new school builds, and full compliance with \u2018modern learning environments\u2019 policy is expected by 2021. These detailed regulations contrast starkly with the openness of the New Zealand Curriculum, which encourages schools to adapt the shape and provision of the curriculum to meet local needs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/nzareblog.wordpress.com\/2017\/10\/02\/how-modern-are-mles\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you read Leon Benade\u2019s NZARE blog post More than bricks and mortar: A critical examination of school property under the National-led Government?
