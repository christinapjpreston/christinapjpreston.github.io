One school in the sample used MAPS for English at Key Stage 1: another school used it for Geography and Music at Key Stage 3. Other schools were working to extend the use of MAPS into other curriculum areas. Feedback from pupils suggested that they used it to store work in a number of subjects, whether or not their teachers used it.<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MAPS effectiveness: Teacher ratings.<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>Teachers were asked to rate the effectiveness of MAPS for a range of tasks: managing assignments, sharing resources with colleagues, tracking pupil progress, whole-school moderation and communicating with pupils. 70% of teachers rated it as being invaluable or valuable for managing assignments; 80% as invaluable or valuable for tracking pupil progress; 60% as valuable for communicating with pupils.<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Range of tasks for which MAPS is used<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>The majority of teachers (80%) use the program for reviewing, commenting on and evaluating pupil work<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">ICT and KS3 Strategy tasks<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>Teachers were asked about the contribution of the ICT and Key Stage 3 Strategy tasks included in MAPS. 70% of the teachers rated these as having an impact on their teaching and pupil learning. Three out of ten teachers rates the resources as valuable.<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Ease of use<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>70% of teachers said that it took less than half a day to become familiar with and use MAPS: not only that, 70% were able to use it without any training. They found the program intuitive. However, the manual, online tutorials, training, support from TAG and the online help topics all contributed to an understanding of the system.<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Impact on teaching<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>TAG MAPS contributes to their management of the ICT curriculum and is rated as valuable or invaluable. Most useful was the ability to allocate tasks to individuals and integrate resources within the work.<\/p>\n<p>Maps has improved submission rates for work with a significant number of students and eliminated \u2018lost\u2019 work.<\/p>\n<p>The overall impact has been in terms of raised standards: students have a snapshot of where they are, and their parents can review progress.<\/p>\n<p>It has changed our entire structure and method of teaching ICT. This has had a knock on effect, where KS3 results have increased significantly, to GCSE where results have almost doubled in the years we have been using MAPS.<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Implementing MAPS<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>As far as MAPS goes I cannot praise the facility or the support staff too highly. Whenever we&#8217;ve asked for help the response has been almost immediate.\u00a0 When we&#8217;ve suggested a facility we would like added it&#8217;s been done.\u00a0 I think it should be a compulsory purchase for all schools, particularly with DIDA and e-portfolios.<\/p>\n<h1>Impact on learning: pupil perspectives<\/h1>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Extent of use<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>The majority of pupils used MAPS once a week as part of their ICT lesson: a minority use it more frequently for other subjects.<\/p>\n<p>36% of pupils use MAPS to send messages to their teachers about their work.<\/p>\n<p>69% of teachers use MAPS to send messages to pupils about their work.<\/p>\n<p>35% of pupils use MAPS at home.<\/p>\n<p>40% assess their own work when they upload it?.<\/p>\n<p>53% do online quizzes or tests.<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Impact on learning<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>A significant number of pupils consider that MAPS helps them to do work that was described as Hard, or Difficult. Others say that it helped them to do work that was challenging or complicated.<\/p>\n<p>Many pupils say that MAPS helps them to hand in their work on time, and that it helps them to move it from home to school; work I need to send to school.<\/p>\n<p>Pupils say that with the program there was no forgetting important pieces of paper. One student wrote that MAPS helped him to do work that was cool.<\/p>\n<p>Pupils say that using MAPS makes them more organised: they feel more in charge of their own work. They have the ability to improve their own work, and engage in personal dialogue with their teachers.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt has made me take more time in my work because it is more fun.<\/em><\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Changing approaches to work<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>Pupils enjoy using MAPS: they regard it as \u2018fun and easy\u2019. There is a strong sense of personal involvement in using the program because of the element of personalisation it affords them. The work itself is personalised, and teacher comments on their work increase the sense of pupil involvement.<\/p>\n<p>There is a strong desire to use MAPS across the curriculum in what many pupils regard as a virtual learning environment.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI think that MAPS is really good and I think we should be able to use it more through out school.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h1>Data analysis<\/h1>\n<p>Between June 15 and July 15 some 60 individuals whose schools were subscribers to MAPS were invited to provide feedback on their uses of the program. Online questionnaires for both teachers and colleagues were hosted on the MirandaNet website. There were fourteen respondents: ten teachers completed the online questionnaire: four teachers provided feedback by telephone or email: all were ICT teachers or co-ordinators. Of non-respondents, 31 were from Sheffield Local Authority and 8 from Worcestershire. There would appear to be issues with schools\u2019 uptake of learning platforms in each authority.<\/p>\n<p>In real terms, therefore, the response rate was 14 teachers from 20 schools: 70%<\/p>\n<p>Meaningful responses were received from 298 pupils in Years 7, 8 &amp; 9 in various schools.<\/p>\n<h2>School background<\/h2>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Virtual Learning Environment or Learning Platform<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>More than half of the schools had, and used, a learning platform in addition to MAPS. 40% of the schools used MAPS as their learning platform. There was no uniformity of provision: Microsoft Learning Gateway, Worcestershire Virtual Workspace, My Internet, Kaleidos, Assimilate and Moodle were all used by schools.<\/p>\n<p>The most commonly used learning platform in the schools surveyed, therefore, was MAPS.<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Key Stages in which MAPS is used<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>All Key Stages were represented in participant schools: the majority, however, were Key Stages 3 &amp; 4.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"148\">KS1<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">KS2<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">KS3<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">KS4<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">Post-16<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"148\">1<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">2<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">8<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">6<\/td>\n<td width=\"148\">2<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h6><\/h6>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Curriculum subjects for which MAPS is used<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>All the schools used MAPS for ICT. One school also used MAPS for English at Key Stage 1: another school used it for Geography and Music at Key Stage 3. In a range of schools, however, there were attempts to involve curriculum areas other than ICT in the use of MAPS. Feedback from pupils suggested that they used it to store work in a number of subjects, whether or not their teachers used it.<\/p>\n<h3>Implementing the program: MAPS and ICT<\/h3>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">How effective is MAPS? Teacher perceptions.<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>Teachers were asked to rate the effectiveness of MAPS on a five-point Lickert-type scale for a range of tasks: managing assignments, sharing resources with colleagues, tracking pupil progress, whole-school moderation and communicating with pupils. For all of these tasks MAPS had made an impact; in many cases a significant impact. 70% of teachers rated it as being invaluable or valuable for managing assignments; 80% as invaluable or valuable for tracking pupil progress; 60% as valuable for communicating with pupils.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"227\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"104\">\u00a0Invaluable<\/td>\n<td width=\"103\">Valuable<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Of some impact<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Of little impact<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Of no impact<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"227\">For managing assignments<\/td>\n<td width=\"104\">30%<\/td>\n<td width=\"103\">40%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">20%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">10%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"227\">Sharing resources with colleagues<\/td>\n<td width=\"104\">20%<\/td>\n<td width=\"103\">30%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">30%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">2%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"227\">Tracking pupil progress<\/td>\n<td width=\"104\">20%<\/td>\n<td width=\"103\">60%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">20%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">0<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"227\">Whole-school moderation<\/td>\n<td width=\"104\">10%<\/td>\n<td width=\"103\">10%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">30%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">20%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">30%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"227\">Communicating with pupils<\/td>\n<td width=\"104\">0<\/td>\n<td width=\"103\">60%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">20%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">20%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Range of tasks for which MAPS is used<\/h3>\n<p>The majority of teachers (80%) use the program for reviewing, commenting on and evaluating pupil work<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\" width=\"738\">\n<strong>I use MAPS for:<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"95\">Creating curriculum links<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">Uploading images<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">Storing reference documents<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">Distributing work templates<\/td>\n<td width=\"91\">Managing website links<\/td>\n<td width=\"84\">Planning<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">Reviewing, commenting on and evaluating work<\/td>\n<td width=\"65\">Other<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"95\">30%<\/td>\n<td width=\"93\">40%<\/td>\n<td width=\"100\">50%<\/td>\n<td width=\"101\">50%<\/td>\n<td width=\"91\">10%<\/td>\n<td width=\"84\">50%<\/td>\n<td width=\"109\">80%<\/td>\n<td width=\"65\">Setting &amp;

When it has been proved that Kaleidos (and the portal) are stable the school plan is then for pupil work to be transferred to the RM product. It is anticipated that skills developed by pupils and staff can be transferred to the new system. A perceived limitation of MAPS is in the way in which pupils try to re-submit work. The teacher feels that it is important to have a series of drafts available for formative assessment. <em>(GSGW)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One training day was used to introduce all of the school staff to MAPS, and it is used as a learning platform in conjunction with My Internet. This school commented on the need for pupils to be able to store various drafts of work, together with the ability to delete a whole set of assessments through the management system of the task that had been set proved inappropriate. This school thought that the product was extremely good value for money. <em>(KE IV CH)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One user commented on the excellent support and service from the company, and could not praise them enough. Integration with data from SIMS had proved problematic, however. <em>(OL&amp;SB)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A school in Derby had suffered a serious fire the previous year, when the school had been burned down. It was now in temporary accommodation, and the teacher responsible for ICT said that MAPS had been a lifeline and meant that what was a crisis had not become a disaster. The program was very stable, and the company provided good support. The messaging system had proved very effective, especially with feedback from pupils. <em>(SCS)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>All of the schools that responded ran post-school sessions for those pupils without ICT or broadband access at home. All of the teachers commented on the program\u2019s value for money.<\/p>\n<h2>Feedback from a former user<\/h2>\n<p>The school\u2019s Internet access goes through a caching service provided by NTL (Hertfordshire Grid).<\/p>\n<p>Because most of MAPS web pages are dynamic the caching system could not provide them fast enough.\u00a0 When lots of students (i.e. a whole class) request a dynamic page the system becomes unusable and this has a big impact on the internet connection speed across the school.\u00a0 This was even evident when a TAG representative came to visit the school and look at the problem.<\/p>\n<p>MAPS does not work with the SIMS database directly.\u00a0 New students often took a while to add to the system.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the SIMS codes were not understood by MAPS, which meant that from September only a few subjects worked.\u00a0 Making the system fully integrated by all subjects was difficult.<\/p>\n<p>This was an expensive mistake for one year because the system could not be used by members of staff across the school.<\/p>\n<p>We were very annoyed that MAPS wanted to charge the school \u00a3500 for providing data which belongs to us at the end of the contract.\u00a0 The school paid \u00a33000 for a service that was barely usable in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>It would be a very good bit of kit, if it worked effectively for us.<\/p>\n<p>Mr J A Dent Head of Information Technology Nicholas Breakspear School, Colney Heath Lane, St.Albans, Herts, AL4 OTT Tel: 01727 860079 \/ Fax: 01727 848912 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nicholasbreakspearschool.co.uk\/\">www.nicholasbreakspearschool.co.uk<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Email: <a href=\"mailto:dentj@nicholasbreakspear.herts.sch.uk\">dentj@nicholasbreakspear.herts.sch.uk<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[\/two_third_last]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>References &amp; Contacts<\/h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">No references available in original case study.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[review]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[\/s2If]<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; MirandaNet &amp; TAG Learning Ltd.
