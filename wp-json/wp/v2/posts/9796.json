Two class will be monitored during the research and an online questionnaire will be used to gain feedback. The two classes in question will be a Year 12, consisting of 7 males and 5 females, and a Year 13 group consisting of 9 male and 2 female members. Both groups are due take two Information and Communication Technology examinations in June 2003. Two different interfaces will be created. One interface will be very basic with no advanced features. The other will allow for emoticons and avatars. It will also have the facility to send instant messages. The project will run until the completion of the students\u2019 examinations in mid June.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Author:n<\/strong><strong>Desi McKeown<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Publication Date:<\/strong> 2003<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em>[s2If !is_user_logged_in()]<\/em><em><mark  class=\"x-highlight\" >More&#8230; <\/mark>To see the complete Case Study, please Login or <a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"My Membership Options Page\" href=\"\/membership-options-page\/\">Join<\/a>.<\/em><em>[\/s2If]<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[s2If is_user_logged_in()]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Study<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is planned that two asynchronous discussion forums will be created in order to allow the teacher to pose examination questions to which the students will respond.
