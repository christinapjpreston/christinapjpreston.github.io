Behaviourism; Developmental Theory; Neuroscience; Brain-based Learning; Learning Styles; Multiple Intelligences; Right Brain\/Left Brain Thinking; Communities of Practice; Control Theory and Problem-Based Learning.\u00a0\u00a0 In practice, however, there is a degree of commonality between many of these categories.<\/p>\n<p>Despite this diversity, praxis within British schools has focused on content, rather than process.\u00a0\u00a0 What theoretical bases can be found are often simplified variants of Constructivism and Developmental Theory.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc443302222\"><\/a>Assumptions<\/h2>\n<p>The \u2018developmental folk myth\u2019 which informs many teachers\u2019 praxis, based upon the popularisation of Piagetian theory, expects learners to pass through a series of stages, each predicating its successor.\u00a0\u00a0 This praxis contains two pillars of received wisdom: learner readiness, and stage competence.\u00a0\u00a0 What this means for students is that, first, they are not expected to be able to cope with concepts and applications which have been determined to lie outside the bounds of their developmental stage: second, that each stage needs to be consolidated by practice.<\/p>\n<p>Much of Piaget\u2019s research took as its focus the growth of mathematical and scientific concepts.\u00a0\u00a0 Children\u2019s ability to understand the tasks which they were set, and to explain them in appropriate terms, was taken as a demonstration of their competence: the language encoded the \u2018scientific\u2019 expectations imposed on the children.\u00a0\u00a0 The methodology and findings have been questioned by a number of researchers (Donaldson, 1978; Gardner, 1983, 1993; Seigel &amp; Brainerd, 1978) but the original thesis still retains its power over pedagogy and the National Curriculum.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc443302223\"><\/a>Broad stages of learning<\/h2>\n<p>The broad stages of the learning paradigm can be summarised as those of learning about; practising and applying.\u00a0\u00a0 The model is very much one of an apprenticeship with the teacher and adult in the role of the master and controller who is also the assessor of success and competence.\u00a0\u00a0 The ultimate arbiter and guarantor of success is the state, through its control over schools, examination boards and universities.<\/p>\n<p>The content and form of learning is therefore both constructed and legitimated in academic and social terms.\u00a0\u00a0 The application of league tables as an apparently neutral scale against which success and failure can be measured is used for the whole of the education systems, whether state or independent, infant school or Oxbridge college.\u00a0\u00a0 The debate over standards is one which is externally imposed on the system, with the students as learners constantly scrutinised to determine whether or not their successes are real or the product of an academic inflation that results in a devaluation of the currency.\u00a0\u00a0 Concurrent with this is the constant scrutiny of the curriculum, to determine whether the cultural capital upon which the students are presuming to trade is genuine or counterfeit, and whether or not Media Studies is as \u2018real\u2019 a subject as Physics and Mathematics.<\/p>\n<h2>The affordances of ICT<\/h2>\n<p>The concept of affordance was developed by Wersch (1998), who saw computers as a tool, a vehicle for combining motor skills, language, images and symbolic manipulation through practical activities.\u00a0\u00a0 These practical activities reflect a series of often complex thought processes.\u00a0\u00a0 They represent a cultural tool that enables the mediation of thought.\u00a0\u00a0 The technology enables these processes to be amplified and developed in ways which reflect the integration of technology and the enhancements that ICT, used as a tool, provides.<\/p>\n<p>ICT affordances facilitate enhanced learning opportunities independent of content or preferred teaching styles.\u00a0\u00a0 For teachers whose approach to teaching and learning is predicated on a Behaviourist or an Information Processing approach the support provided by ICT, in terms of feedback to the learner, error messages, prompts, template and wizards provides a powerful reinforcement of learning.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, these affordances underpin independent learning systems and many managed or virtual learning environments.\u00a0\u00a0 Teachers whose pedagogy is grounded in Constructivism, Multiple Intelligence theory or Learning styles will utilise the rich learning experiences provided by diverse materials, collaborative working where knowledge is inseparable from practice.<\/p>\n<p>Three powerful elements of ICT provide drivers for e-learning.\u00a0\u00a0 The first is the quality of ostensiveness built into the system: young children correlate language with concepts by the act of pointing at things.\u00a0\u00a0 This reinforces the learning.\u00a0\u00a0 ICT systems utilize this through the use of the mouse, or, on interactive whiteboards, with the stylus or the finger.\u00a0\u00a0 Visualization, and the ability to move backwards and forwards through the different stages of a process or a learning object, enables learners to recall the stages of learning.\u00a0\u00a0 A powerful reinforcement is provided by the ludic elements built into systems: through games, competitive elements and constant feedback, learning becomes fun.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge is to incorporate of the affordances of ICT within a new pedagogy for e-learning.\u00a0\u00a0 This will involve new learning on the part of teachers, together with the recognition, on their part, of the dynamic nature of a new pedagogy, in which a process of continual change must be accommodated.\u00a0\u00a0 For learners who are pupils or students, however, the existential reality will be one of living at the cutting edge of technology, where the tools they use and the concepts they forge are an integral part of the learning process.<\/p>\n<p>Teachers\u2019 concepts of the learning process inform their pedagogical approach.\u00a0\u00a0 The ways in which they feel they learned successfully inform the template of their own teaching.\u00a0\u00a0 The successful implementation of e-learning into our education system will depend, to an extent, on teachers\u2019 personal uses of ICT and e-learning, whether for access to resources, continuous professional development or communities of practice.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning styles<\/h2>\n<p>Learning styles are the different ways in which individuals think and learn.\u00a0\u00a0 These become formalised as expectations and behaviour, which the individual then brings to the task of learning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The stages of learning can be separated into three broad areas: cognition, the acquisition of knowledge; conceptualisation, the processing of knowledge and the affective factors related to these.\u00a0\u00a0 The focus is therefore on the process of learning.<\/p>\n<p>Kolb (1984) saw learning as an active process.\u00a0\u00a0 Its stages formed a continuum, from concrete experience:(involvement); reflective observation, watching others or developing observations about one\u2019s own experience; through abstract conceptualization: the creation of theories to explain one\u2019s observations; to active experimentation, using theories to solve problems and make decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Gardner (1983) identified different types of learning, particularly those characterised as \u2018know-how\u2019 and \u2018know that\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0 From that he defined \u2018multiple intelligences\u2019, to describe the different ways (and combinations of ways) in which individuals learn.\u00a0\u00a0 Learning can be seen as \u2018playing\u2019 with different capabilities: the verbal\/linguistic; logical\/mathematical; visual\/spatial; musical\/rhythmic; bodily\/kinesthetic; social\/interpersonal and personal.\u00a0\u00a0 This perspective provides an immediate rationale for the use of computers by young people: the combination of play elements \u2013 the ludic \u2013 the use of language as part of the process, together with visual stimulus, means that the computer provides a focus for different types of learning.<\/p>\n<p>Some, however, assume that the young learner &#8211; a child &#8211; is not the same as a mature learner &#8211; an adult, and that the learning styles must be different (Knowles, 1970).\u00a0\u00a0 Adult learners are often characterised as autonomous and self-directed; goal oriented; problem centred and needing to know why the learning is taking place.\u00a0\u00a0 Adults are seen as practical problem solvers, able to draw on accumulated life experience.\u00a0\u00a0 The young learner, the child, is assumed to possess few, if any, of these characteristics.<\/p>\n<p>Learning strategies for adult learners have been grouped in binary terms by Felder &amp; Soloman (1998).\u00a0\u00a0 They have re-worked Gardner\u2019s concept of multiple intelligences into descriptions of active and reflective learners; sensing and intuitive learners; visual and verbal learners and sequential and global learners.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, Gardner comments that<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u2026intuitive theories remain as prepotent ways of knowing and are likely to reemerge with full force once the person leaves a scholastic milieu.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 (<\/em>1993, p.86)<\/p>\n<p>The point is made that computers are artefacts that reinforce intuitive understanding and ways of knowing and learning.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[\/two_third_last]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243;
