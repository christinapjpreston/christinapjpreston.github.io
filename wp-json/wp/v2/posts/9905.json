Being \u2018savvy\u2019 in an online world was thought to be one of the key elements of digital literacy, the counterweight in this discussion. However, as Allison pointed out, the Royal Society definition seemed to miss this element, considering it to be, \u201cthe basic skill or ability to use a computer confidently, safely and effectively\u201d emphasising office software, a very functional view of technology use.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas attendees were more inclined to agree with Futurelab\u2019s less prescriptive, more holistic view that it requires \u2018critically engaging\u2019 with technology, and encompasses \u2018an understanding of the cultural and social contexts\u2019 in which information is accessed and created. Overall it is about, \u201cthe \u2018savvyness\u2019 that allows young people to participate meaningfully and safely as digital technology becomes ever more pervasive in society.\u201d; the Naace Curriculum Framework adopts this version.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst e-safe behaviour is a quality we are seeking to inculcate in our young people, it is one that is sometimes lacking in ourselves, the adults working with them. The group most at risk of identity theft, for instance, are older men, from 45-60, in part because of the accumulation of their online data. But they are run a close second byadults between 18 and 24 who are more cavalier with their online protection and personal data, and have less of a credit history \u2013 fewer County Court Judgements, for instance \u2013 and so are more attractive to fraudsters.<\/p>\n<p>Another area of concern is adults who use their children\u2019s images as their identifiers on social networking sites such as Facebook, or who post photos of events such as birthday parties without concern for who might call them up.<\/p>\n<p>One key element, however, is that skill for living, learning and working online is part of 21<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0Century life, that young people have a right to connect and communicate, as exemplified by the Oldham Youth Council\u2019s Charter of Digital Rights. This is a positive approach to safeguarding that starts from the premise of what young people have a right to expect, and the responsibilities this brings.<\/p>\n<p>This is a more active view of staying safe online, one that suggest that it is not just what others do, but also what young people themselves do, that helps to either make them vulnerable or protect them. As John Cuthell suggested, it is essentially behavioural issues that need to be addressed, but without losing sight of the technical ones. In his experience, when pupils were asked to be active participants in ensuring promoting positive online behaviour they would report bullying or plagiarism as they saw this as part of their responsibilities, too.\u00a0\u00a0The framework within which safeguarding takes place, the school ethos, is possibly more important than the rules and procedures laid down. In the well known \u201cPIES model\u201d; Policies, Infrastructure, Education and Standards the most important is Education.<\/p>\n<p>The problems that e-Safety may create can bring about a state of FUD in schools \u2013 Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, but with clear mechanisms, clarity of everybody\u2019s roles, and good communication the risks can be significantly reduced, and while\u00a0unfortunately, never completely removed technology also mitigates risk by increasing visibility of issues and assurance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[review]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[\/s2If]<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; [divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;] Article Since e-safety seems to be, inexplicably, a casualty of the new Computing Curriculum, MirandaNet member, John Galloway, has gained his Fellowship by reporting on Allison Allen\u2019s presentation about e-safety in the MirandaNet loungue at &#8230; <\/p>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/blog\/2013\/04\/27\/can-teachers-avoid-creating-fear-uncertainty-and-doubt\/\" class=\"more-link\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[279],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-9905","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-esafety","no-post-thumbnail"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9905"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=9905"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9905\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=9905"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=9905"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mirandanet.ac.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=9905"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
