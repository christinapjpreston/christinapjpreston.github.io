Within my proposal I did predict that the children would enjoy and learn from this experience &#8211; but I did not apprehend how successful it would be. Attitude<\/p>\n<p>It took a couple of weeks for the programme to be up and running on a daily basis (with the classroom assistant to monitor the quizzes and the books being taken in and out). The children were always eager to participate in a quiz, and write their name on the 100% board. The 100% board was an innovation. I started halfway through the programme, where the children who achieved 100% wrote their name on the baoard with a gold pen that stood at the front of the classroom.<\/p>\n<p>It was an instant success in terms of encouraging children to read and a positive change had occurred within their attitude towards reading. They were enthusiastic to read, to take the quiz and then to write about it on Think.com. At first it was a selected number of pupils who participated, but the other pupils were constantly asking to participate and stressing how &#8216;unfair&#8217; it was &#8211; so we adapted the plan to allow the entire class to participate, although I will only focus on those I planned to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quizzes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The quizzes took place every morning (when possible), where the children would come into the ICT suite under the supervision of a teaching assistant (who I had trained). Once the children had taken the quiz they would then change their books. One problem that we found within the first couple of weeks was that the children were so keen to take a quiz that they were either not reading the book properly or choosing books that were too difficult as they were failing quite a few quizzes.<\/p>\n<p>Once we noticed this pattern, we started to monitor the books that the children were choosing &#8211; and then found they were choosing books that were too easy so they could read it within a night. We had not anticipated these problems so had not really spoken to the children about it. As a result we then used the points and book level with much more caution (we were able to do this as we knew the children&#8217;s reading ability &#8211; a stranger would find this very difficult to monitor).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Think.com<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finding time to go on Think.com was a little more difficult than first anticipated due to problems with the ICT timetable, and the everyday problems you face within any school. When we were in the ICT suite I was a little too trusting (in hindsight) as I instructed the children to write about Accelerated Reader and left them to it to a certain extent as I did not want to interfere with their opinions\/perspectives. However, a few weeks later we looked as a class at the work on Think.com and I was faced with quite a few empty Accelerated Reader pages, as they had been busy elsewhere within the website.<\/p>\n<p>Looking back, I should have monitored this work much more closely. As a result of this the following ICT lessons were much more structured &#8211; they were given clear instructions to either<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an article (writing about the previous\/current Accelerated Reader Book the read)<\/li>\n<li>Create a debate .
