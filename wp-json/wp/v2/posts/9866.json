Background<\/strong><br \/>\nICT can make significant contribution to teaching and learning. It is a new teaching tendency to use Interactive Whiteboards (IWB) to promote the transformation of teaching and learning. With such a consensus, Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences (BAES) and the company of Promethean and Mirandanet Fellowship will jointly initiate a collaborative project on applying IWB in Beijing schools. For this, Mirandanet has agreed to offer two sets of IWB including electronic projectors, relevant facilities and teaching resources, as well as professional technique services to support the project for free.<br \/>\nOne facility will be installed in BAES to provide IWB training for teachers in primary and secondary schools in Beijing. The other will be installed in Beijing No. 50 Secondary School to conduct experiments in classroom teaching.<br \/>\nThis project was made on the agreement between BAES and the company of Promethean &amp; Mirandanet Fellowship.<br \/>\nIn the June of 2005, in order to benefit more schools in Beijing the company of Promethean provided IWB at half price after BAES had negotiated with Promethean. Till then, there are eleven schools including the 50th Secondary school had installed IWB, and four of them have used one or two boards for teaching before.<br \/>\nAt present, there are eight IWB projected schools including the 50th middle school in Beijing. Because of the problem in transportation and installation, the installation of IWB in those schools was finished until the end of 2005. The projected teachers just started to use the IWB, some only have got training, some have used for 1 to 3 months, but majority have not got the opportunity for training, so the task for training is still significant.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Methodology<\/strong><br \/>\nIn order to study the applicability of IWB in class in Beijing, and the effects of using IWB to transfer teaching and learning, BAES carried on the survey in two secondary schools and one primary school within eleven project schools. The two secondary schools are the 50th middle school using IWB for ten months and the 14th middle schools using IWB for nearly two years; the primary school has used IWB for 3 to 4 months.<br \/>\nBecause the use of IWB has just started, only minor teachers and students participated in the survey. Small number of the questionnaires are recalled, 20 for teachers and 129 for students.<br \/>\nBesides the survey, BAES has observed lessons, organized discussions about the use of IWB in teaching, and collected the data from teachers and students.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The following are our research results<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>3\u00a3\u00c6 Data analysis<\/strong><br \/>\n3.11 About the teachers: In the project schools, IWB is used in Math, English, Chinese, Geography, Complex practice, Physics, Chemistry, Art and so on especially in Math and English occupying 60%. The average age of the teachers is 31, and the average teaching experience is nine years.<br \/>\n3.12. About Installation of IWB: In Most of the project schools in Beijing, IWB is installed in special classroom, because they only have several pieces of IWB.<br \/>\n3.13 About Using IWB: According to the investigation, 57.9% of the teachers use IWB only once or twice, 15.8% use it at least once a month, and the other 15.8% use it at least once a week. So IWB is not commonly used, and teachers still prefer the traditional blackboard.<br \/>\nIn NO. 50 Secondary school, 62.5% of teachers use IWB once or twice, 12.5% use it at least once a week, and 12.5% use it at least once a day.<br \/>\nAccording to the feedback from students in the three schools, 68.5% students said that their teachers seldom used IWB, which is similar to result in teachers\u2019 survey.<br \/>\n3.14\u00a3\u00c6About Training for IWB: 50% of the teachers could master the basic skills after one or two days\u2019 training, 16.7% needs three or four days training, while the others needs more time.<br \/>\n3.2Feedback from Teachers<br \/>\n3.21 The data shows that IWB are appreciated by most of teachers in the following aspects.<br \/>\nTable 1<br \/>\nItem<br \/>\nAre there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard . \u00a3\u00ae%\u00a3\u00a9agreement percentage<br \/>\nAll the teachers The 14th middle school The 50th middle school<br \/>\n1 Promoting the interactivity and communication between teachers and students, and between students themselves 94.4 90.0 75.0<br \/>\n2 Inspiring students\u2019 interests in studies 90.0 90.0 87.5<br \/>\n3 Improving students\u2019 thinking ability 88.9 90.0 62.5<br \/>\n4 Being helpful for changing the traditional teaching methods 83.3 90.0 50.0<br \/>\n5 Protecting environments, good for health 83.3 70.0 75.0<br \/>\n6 Being easily and conveniently operated. 83.3 70.0 75.0<br \/>\nComparing the feedback from NO.14 with 50 Secondary Schools, which uses IWB for two years and ten months respectively in Table 1, we can conclude that the longer the teachers use, the more advantages the teachers get, especially in transferring traditional teaching.<br \/>\n3.22 The data shows that IWB are positively commented by part of teachers in the following aspects.<br \/>\nTable 2<br \/>\nItem Are there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard. agreement percentage<br \/>\nAll the teachers The 14th middle school The 50th middle school<br \/>\n1 Using teaching assistant resources is convenient 66.7 80.0 25.0<br \/>\n2 The demonstration of IWB is more suitable for students. 66.7 50.0 62.5<br \/>\n3 Facilitating the preparation for class and the accumulation of teaching resources. 55.6 60.0 25.0<br \/>\n4 Making the teaching more efficient 44.4 40.0 25.0<br \/>\nThe data from Table 2 clearly shows that more practice makes the use of IWB easier and more effective, which makes the teachers easily prepare the lessons.<br \/>\n3.23 The data shows that the advantages of IWB are not fully accepted in the following aspects.<\/p>\n<p>Table3<br \/>\nItem .\u00ac\uf8ff\u00a3\u00f8Are there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard . agreement percentage<br \/>\nAll the teachers The 14th middle school The 50th middle school<br \/>\n1 Improving the students\u2019 achievements. 11.1 10.0 0<br \/>\n2 Enhancing the students\u2019 self-learning ability. 27.8 10.0 25.0<br \/>\nThe data shows that so far we don\u2019t have enough evidence to prove the students\u2019 achievements.<br \/>\n3.3 Feedback from Students<br \/>\n3.31 The data shows that IWB are appreciated by most of teachers in the following aspects..<br \/>\nTable 4<br \/>\nItem Are there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard Agreement percentage<br \/>\nAll the students The 14th middle school The 50th middle school primary school<br \/>\n1 Making the teaching more interesting and vivid 81.4 70.8 79.2 100<br \/>\n2 Inspiring our interests in studying 76.7 64.6 77.1 93.9<br \/>\n3 Preferring the classes with IWB 74.4 43.8 89.6 97.0<br \/>\n4 Making studies more direct and clearer 72.1 68.8 66.7 84.8<br \/>\n5 Protecting environment, good for health 73.2 54.2 81.3 90.3<br \/>\nThe data shows that the primary school students are more interested in IWB, while secondary school students are not likely to be attracted by various superficial demonstrations<br \/>\n3.32 The data shows that IWB are positively commented by part of teachers in the following aspects.<br \/>\nTable 5<br \/>\nItem Are there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard Agreement percentage<br \/>\nAll the students The 14th middle school The 50th middle school primary school<br \/>\n1 Activating the classes 67.4 87.9 68.8 52.1<br \/>\n2 There are many opportunities to operate IWB 62.0 97.0 43.8 56.3<br \/>\n3 Promoting the interactivity and communication between teachers and students, and between students themselves 54.3 90.9 33.3 50.0<br \/>\nThe data shows that the more time they have lessons with IWB, the more interactive their learning is.<\/p>\n<p>3.33 The data shows that the advantages of IWB are not fully accepted in the following aspects.<br \/>\nTable 6<br \/>\nItem Are there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard?

It is the gradual process to improve the students\u2019 achievements using IWB.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.Conclusion<\/strong><br \/>\n4.1 Teaching with IWB not only supported didactic, catches students\u2019 attention, inspires students\u2019 interest by the main tools toolbox, but also transform learning and teaching, makes the teaching more easily. There is more evidence in primary school than junior high school.<br \/>\n4.2 The more time they have lessons with IWB, the more interactive their learning is, and the less the visual effect they have, which help to change traditional pedagogy into interactive learning and teaching.<br \/>\n4.3 The more time the teachers use IWB in the lesson, the much clever and be good at using the resource library they have. And the teachers said when they prepare the lesson using IWB they could save the time a little. And also it is useful to review for the teachers\u2019 development.<br \/>\n4.4 Although we don\u2019t have enough evidence to prove the students\u2019 achievements in such a short time, which is a gradual process, there are already some evidences showing that the more time the students have lesson using IWB, the more evidence the students have in impacting student\u2019s thinking and ability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Problems which need to improved<\/strong><br \/>\n5.1 The pen, which right key and double click do not work well, not sensitive enough, and broken easily.<br \/>\n5.2 IWB could not match with some laptop.<br \/>\n5.3 Frequently changing between EIWB and other software causes breakdown.<br \/>\n5.4 The resource library is all in English, which is the largest obstacle to its use in China. We need resources more appropriate for Chinese.<br \/>\n5.5 The schools in Beijing suggest that teaching with IWB be proper for the class size with less than forty students.<br \/>\n5.6 The students at the front can not endure the bright light.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Questionnaire for teachers<\/strong><br \/>\nDear teachers<br \/>\nThe Questionnaire is designed research only, your answers will be kept secret.<br \/>\nThere are some options after the questions, you should mark the most proper one with \u00b0\u221e\u00b0\u00c3\u00b0\u00b1in \u00b0\u221e\u00b0\u0131\u00b0\u00b1.Thanks for your support!<br \/>\nIWB Project<br \/>\n02-2006<\/p>\n<p><strong>101.The type of your school<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00b0\u0131\u00a3\u00ae1\u00a3\u00a9Middle school. \u00b0\u0131\u00a3\u00ae2\u00a3\u00a9Secondary School \u00b0\u0131\u00a3\u00ae3\u00a3\u00a9High school\u00b0\u0131\u00a3\u00ae4\u00a3\u00a9\u2013\u00b0\u2014\u00df\u00b0\u00a3Primary school<br \/>\n102.
