With a click of a button, the reader\u2019s own message can be submitted. Once the message has been \u2018posted\u2019 it can be read by other members of the forum. Many of the messages posted in the Mirandanet forum invite others to post a response. In this context, it follows that communication skills are vitally important.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Within an online forum, messages build up quickly to form a database of knowledge on a particular subject.\u00a0 Clear, fluid messages in the online forum are within themselves a pleasure to read and\/or offer new ideas to the reader. Strong communication skills tend to invite a response and many of the messages posted in the Mirandanet forum thanked others, for their contribution summaries of ideas or new information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Members of the Mirandanet forum tended to agree with the conclusion that communicaton skills are important in the context of the online forum.\u00a0 One member, for instance, put communication skills were \u2018at the top\u2019 of [ her] list of important skills.\u00a0 From practical experience, one of the most gratifying aspects of communication in online forums is having someone answer your question, respond to your message.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we look more closely at the area of communication skills, we could identify further specific communication skills which are important including:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to be passionate about communication<\/p>\n<p>-ability to express thoughts in fluid, written communications at all levels<\/p>\n<p>-ability to contribute outside information, relevant to the subject of discussion<\/p>\n<p>-ability to acknowledge what has been previously said<\/p>\n<p>-ability to summarise ideas<\/p>\n<p>-ability to post thoughtful discussion questions<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Presentation skills are important for effective participation in an online forum (including the presentation of facts and figures)\u00a0 Editing skills are important since attractively crafted and presented text can\u00a0 serve to engage the attention of the reader.\u00a0 From practical experience, one of the most gratifying aspects of communication in online forums is having someone answer your question, respond to your message.\u00a0 Communication and language, in particular, are the tools of these activities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Interpersonal Skills<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A reply to an online forum message implies that the message was received &#8211; that someone was listening.\u00a0 If we imagine that behind each communication in an online forum lies a real person then we begin to understand the importance of interpersonal skills for participation in an online forum.\u00a0 One definition of interpersonal skills posted within the Mirandanet forum suggests that interpersonal skills:<br \/>\n&#8220;\u2026 are related to communication skills, but are more specific about individual behaviors. They include cooperating, sharing, listening, participating, and leading. They also include respecting others.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Interpersonal skills are important in this context because, despite the fact that members of the online forum (at Mirandanet, for instance) cannot see or hear each other, they are being social, forming new relationships. Strong interpersonal skills can serve to compensate for the limitations of the online forum.\u00a0 These skills contribute to effective participation by helping making the text messages in the forum more personal, helping other users to engage in the forum on a human level.<br \/>\nAnalysing the area of interpersonal skills further, uncovers further skills important for participating in an online discussion.\u00a0 These include:<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to adapt to the rules and the ethos of the forum<\/p>\n<p>-ability to develop networks and relationships with others<\/p>\n<p>-ability to support and encourage sociability<\/p>\n<p>-ability to work well as part of a team<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to foster and develop collaborative links<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to see past non-verbal clues<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to\u00a0 appear approachable and interested in what is going on<\/p>\n<p>-skills in negotiation and diplomacy, including the ability to relate to those from diverse backgrounds<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A sense of humour can be seen as a valuable interpersonal skill in the context of the online forum helping users to relate to others and\u00a0 to balance relationships.\u00a0 In a sense, interpersonal skills help the user of the forum to manage the relationships which they attract online.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Management Skills<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Management skills are also important for participation in an online forum.\u00a0 These skills help to organize ideas so that they form clear communications for others in the forum.\u00a0 They also relate finding a comfortable life\/work balance so that time spent in the forum is effective and balanced with other user activities. Important skills which could be described as management skills include:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Good organizational skills<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to stay focused on the task at hand<\/p>\n<p>-ability to initiate and develop ideas (initiative and leadership skills<\/p>\n<p>-team building skills<\/p>\n<p>-ability to initiate change<\/p>\n<p>-ability to inspire and enthuse others<\/p>\n<p>-ability to motivate others to achieve high levels of performance<\/p>\n<p>-ability to work independently, as well as part of a team.<\/p>\n<p>-ability to initiate and support new ways of working<\/p>\n<p>-ability to balance complex demands<\/p>\n<p>-ability to manage the influx and flow of ideas<\/p>\n<p>-ability to prioritise ideas an activities<\/p>\n<p>-ability to find or make time to participate in the forum<\/p>\n<p>-ability to work to deadlines<\/p>\n<p>-ability to think strategically, and to have strategies for dealing with problems and<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We can also find a\u00a0 number of\u00a0 skills which in this area which relate to emotional self-management.\u00a0 These include:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to have positive and friendly attitude towards all levels of users<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to stay calm in a complex and fast-changing environment<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technical Skills<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Users of online forums need at least basis computer knowledge\/skills.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These include the:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-ability to feel comfortable with the system software<\/p>\n<p>-ability to feel at ease with word-processing, Internet\/e-mail facilities<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Some knowledge of computer maintenance, simple presentation software, and antivirus packages may also be required.<br \/>\nIn addition to these skills e-facilitators should have slightly more<br \/>\nadvanced skills (actually responsibilities) to operate in on-line environment<br \/>\ne.g. to delete or alter any message or to remove irrelevant or offensive<br \/>\nmaterial.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Other Skills:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Other skills required for participation in online forums not mentioned so far, include the:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; ability to be resourceful, to \u2018problem-solve\u2019<\/p>\n<p>-the ability to support new methods of research<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; the ability to reflect on contributions, including those of self<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; the ability to evaluate contributions to the forum, including those of self<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conclusion<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, each of the skills identified above (to various degrees) are important for effective participation in an online forum.\u00a0\u00a0 On further analysis, these skills are not so straightforward to pigeonhole under one heading.\u00a0 For instance, \u2018the ability to post meaningful discussion questions\u2019 could be a communication skill or an interpersonal skill\u00a0 (the ability to support and encourage sociability) or a management skill (the ability to inspire and enthuse others).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>3: Investigate a range of online educational forums. Participate in at least three. Evaluate the ways in which they work, record your contributions and comment on them.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Online educational forums\u00a0 became a topic for discussion\u00a0 within the Mirandanet online forum during May-June 2004.\u00a0 The discussion \u2019 Investigate a range of online forums\u2019 opened on 13.05.04.\u00a0 Less then five weeks later, the topic\u00a0 had attracted over 70 responses.\u00a0 The evaluation of a range of online forums which follows is based on personal experience and practical research.\u00a0\u00a0 It includes ideas and information discussed in the online\u00a0 educational forum of Mirandanet online forum and\u00a0 to date, this discussion continues.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The online, educational forums which I investigated\u00a0 have a number of interesting features.\u00a0 Like at the online education forum at\u00a0 Mirandanet<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"\/\">mirandanet.ac.uk<\/a>) members of these online forums can exchange information via discussion.\u00a0 For instance the website of The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA) has an area in its website (at http\/forum.ngfl.gov.uk) where members are invited to discuss online a range of issues related to education. The website of the General Teaching Council (GTC)\u00a0\u00a0 has an online discussion area (at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gfcs.gov.uk\/\">www.gfcs.gov.uk<\/a>) where members are invited to participate.\u00a0 The website of Select Education also has an online discussion area at\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selecteducation.co.uk\/\">www.selecteducation.co.uk<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Because these online educational forums rely on active participation they employ a number of techniques, mechanisms, systems and procedures to encourage users to engage with the online discussion and exchange information via the Internet.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For instance, each online forum has a registration process and selected topics of discussion in which user can post a message which is a response to a previous message.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These online educational forums are asynchronous \u2013 they take place over time. They are all accessed via a computer terminal and the Internet and do not depend on participants being in the same room.\u00a0 In addition to these similarities , there is a potential for posted messages to build up over time\u00a0 to form a store of knowledge around key ideas in each forum.\u00a0 The popularity of these sites with users suggests that the online discussion area answers a need within individuals to be part of an online community with shared interests.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, there are a number of key differences between these online educational\u00a0 forums<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most significant difference between the Mirandanet forum and the other forums investigated is the fact that at Mirandanet the participants met together in the real world before they began to communicate online.\u00a0 This means that participants at the Mirandanet forum are aware that the messages in the forum are the responses of real people.\u00a0 Moreover the participants of the Mirandanet forums are committed to training in efacilitation and the discussion of topics online. Topics posted in the Mirandanet discussion forum are extremely relevant to participants &#8211; vital to their progress in their course of training \/ development of their efacilitation skills.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In additional, participants in the Mirandanet site work as collaborative group and are aware that their contributions to the forum are being observed and assessed.\u00a0 They are thus motivated to post regularly to respond and to respond to the messages of others.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, it is noticeable that although other online forums had various discussion topics, some of these\u00a0\u00a0 had a much less regular rate of response in comparison to the topics in\u00a0\u00a0 the Mirandanet discussion area.\u00a0 Most of the topics in the other forums seemed to feature one or two people exchanging views amongst themselves. The lack of response by other participants in the forum suggests that the topics less popular or not engaging.\u00a0 It is also significant that the GTC and BECTA online discussion forums contained archives of past discussions which were closed when investigated further.\u00a0 This allowed the user to \u2018lurk\u2019 or browse the contents of the discussion without being under any pressure or obligation to post a contribution.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another significant difference is that some online educational forums had efacilitators or online moderators and some did not. At BECTA for instance, online discussions took place at a specific time, on a specific topic\u00a0 with \u2018talking heads\u2019 or efacilitators \u2013 online discussion hosts skilled in generating online discussions and managing their development.\u00a0 These efacilitators employed a range of techniques ( including \u2018sparks\u2019 \u2013 challenging or interesting topics of information and open-ended questions\/activities which include participants) to engage other users of the site.\u00a0 For instance, a\u00a0 discussion on the subject of \u2018elearning futures\u2019 at BECTA took place online between 4<sup>th<\/sup> and 5<sup>th<\/sup> March 2004, with the efacilitators appearing at specific times during the discussion to take questions\u2026.\u00a0 \u2018Linda, John and Richard will be online from 8pm until 9pm GMT \u2026. (BECTA)\u00a0 Users were invited to join the debate &#8216;live&#8217; or post\u00a0 questions for the panel members any time before the session.\u00a0 However, further investigation revealed these particular online, education forums to have\u00a0 closed, perhaps years ago.\u00a0 Or yet to open. By contrast, (at the time of writing this study) all the online the discussions at\u00a0 Mirandanet\u00a0 are current, and open, encouraging further\u00a0 response.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are some\u00a0 notable technical differences in the way in which each site works.\u00a0 The GTC site for instance, has different software to the Mirandanet site.\u00a0 This means that the software at the GTC site puts the answers to posted messages further apart and in a different way. This software will also tell you whether you have already read the messages or not .\u00a0\u00a0 The Mirandanet\u00a0\u00a0 forum also\u00a0 has this facility whilst the Select forum does not.\u00a0 However the software at the Select forum allows the user to know the number of other users who have read the message, and how many have responded by posting a reply.\u00a0 Differences in the software mean that it is possible that first time users to each site may experience difficulties in accessing the forum, even though they\u00a0 may have participated in other online forums.\u00a0 For example, one contributor to the Mirandanet online forum found it difficult to access the GTC online forum.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>During investigation of the various online educational forums it was difficult to post a response to the discussions at BECTA.\u00a0 The\u00a0 site had a guest book, but\u00a0 I felt more comfortable reading previous messages rather than contributing to the discussion,\u00a0 since many were \u2018closed\u2019.\u00a0 However at the GTC online discussion during June 2004 I felt involved with the discussion and able to contribute to the discussion entitled \u2018Encouraging Diversity\u2019 , efacilitated by Shirley Williams.\u00a0 I contributed to the discussion under my own name of Sandra Weinreb rather than a pseudonym at 11.05am on 24.05.04. My intention in contributing was to support the discussion.\u00a0\u00a0 This intention arose because it\u00a0 was noticeable at the GTC, that the discussion was being regularly hijacked by participants using pseudynoms who worked to disrupt the discussion and who were hostile to their online host.\u00a0 I left my message open-ended with a question\u2019 What do others think?\u2019\u00a0 to encourage further response.\u00a0 This message quickly attracted four responses from other participants.\u00a0 By comparison my closed message (ended with a statement rather than a question) in the Mirandanet discussion forum (09. 06.04 attracted a slower rate of response.\u00a0\u00a0 My statement regarding part time drama teaching in the \u2018Good Practice\u2019 discussion area of the Select Education forum (24.05.04, 11.05am)\u00a0 teachers attracted a message in a private area of the forum in which the poster of the message sought career advice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4 :Use Salmon\u2019s 5-step model to evaluate your progress and learning on this course.\u00a0 How effective was it for you?\u00a0 How did it relate to your own learning style?\u00a0 How does it relate to the ways in which children and young people learn?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Gilly Salmon\u2019s 5-Step model (1) aims to explain the processes involved in happy and successful online learning.

(stage 1).\u00a0 The contributions to the online discussions are characterized by their use of language and symbols.\u00a0 For instance, some contributors to the online discussion are characterised by a more regular use of emoticon symbols or formal language.\u00a0 This creation of an on-line personality could be said to reflect the <strong>online socialization<\/strong> phase of the model (stage 2).\u00a0\u00a0 Some contributions to the\u00a0 online discussion at Mirandanet\u00a0 are direct responses to previous contributions.\u00a0 These contributions challenge, support or develope\u00a0 previous messages &#8211;\u00a0 an activity which could be described as an <strong>exchange of information<\/strong> (stage 3). Our contributions to online discussion have built up to form an online knowledge base which can be said to be a form of <strong>knowledge construction <\/strong>(stage 4<strong>)<\/strong>.\u00a0 Finally, we reach the phase of the model which often results in the participants return to more individual pursuits.\u00a0 This can be related to the requirement of the emoderation course that participants develop their own, individual research projects.\u00a0\u00a0 This activity requires that participants demonstrating the <strong>development<\/strong> of knowledge gained as a result of taking part in the course (stage 5).\u00a0 In other words, our course had been carefully structured so as to facilitate learning and mastery of the technical and emoderation skills as described in each stage of Salmon\u2019s model.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The course has also provided opportunities to interact with experienced emoderaters.\u00a0 As members of\u00a0 the\u00a0 online community at Mirandanet, participants go through a process of induction into the software of the online discussion, being welcomed and encouraged to welcome other\u00a0 participants to the online forums, before developing deeper level interactions (such as supporting, responding to\u00a0 contributions to the online discussion at Mirandanet).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, further evaluation of Salmon\u2019s model in relation to our online community demonstrates that the stages of the model overlap and are therefore not clear cut. Experienced emoderators have\u00a0 have been supportive and responsive to participants from the beginning of the course \u2013 but in Salmon\u2019s model this activity by the emoderator only takes place at stage 5 in the learning process.\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the model takes only online learning into account does not account for participants off-line activities which may also support their online learning \u2013 such as reading a book or face-to-face interactions.\u00a0\u00a0 The model also implies that online learning is a clear movement between different stages. However, does an intense level of online interaction mean that participants have automatically reached stage 4 of the model as Salmon suggests?\u00a0 Because the stages of the model are not clear cut on closer analysis, it can be difficult for participants to judge the learning progress in terms of Salmon\u2019s model.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For me, a wholistic approach to learning works best &#8211;\u00a0 often the most effective approach but not always possible to explain in terms of a single theory.\u00a0\u00a0 A gradual movement around a learning curve (which in itself forms part of a larger circle)rather then a movement from step to step is perhaps a more\u00a0 accurate description of my own learning style.\u00a0 For me, then, Salmon\u2019s model has some relevance but is also simplistic and rigid, posing a number of contradictions. \u00a0To evaluate participant learning in terms of the model is not an easy process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we relate Salmon\u2019s model to the ways in which children and young people learn then,<\/p>\n<p>Piaget&#8217;s theories can be said to have influenced much of the structure of the curriculum in the schools in which I have taught in London.<\/p>\n<p>However in my experience there have also been individuals, classes or teaching groups where I have observed the influence or practice of other educational theories such as Vygotsky, or Communities of Practice, or even Control Theory as approaches to the teaching or learning situation for children and especially young people. Salmon&#8217;s model is distinguished by its focus on only one aspect of learning &#8211; online learning. Thus it follows that this theory could be applicable in situations where children and young people are involved in online learning, but not in other aspects of their development (such as development of skills in practical drama or art) where other educational theories may be more relevant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Notes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>For further detail on Salmon\u2019s 5-step theory and a full diagram of the model visit<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.atimode.com\/\">www.atimode.com<\/a> or see <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Etivities<\/span> by Gilly Salmon, Kogan Page Limited,<\/p>\n<p>London, 2002, reprinted 2003<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>See<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Etivities<\/span> by Gilly Salmon, Kogan Page Limited,<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>London, 2002, reprinted 2003, p.12<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]\n<p><strong>References &amp; Contacts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bibliography:\u00a0 Etivities,\u00a0 Gilly Salmon, Kogan Page Limited, London, 2002, reprinted 2003<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sandra Weinreb<\/p>\n[divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;]\n[review]\n[\/s2If]\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; [divide margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; color=&#8221;#a0a0a0&#8243;] Abstract This study is a compilation of four assignments designed to chart personal and group progress in e-learning within a course of e-facilitation. 1.
