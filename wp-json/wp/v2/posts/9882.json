At present, the school consists 53 classes with 2560 students, including 1060 juniors aged from 13-15 and 1500 seniors aged from 16-18. There are 152 teachers.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Now the application of computer in the education of every subject has become prevalent in our school. The teachers carry out educational activities through nets, such as making preparations together within the campus before giving classes, making a living educational report of the network class, answering the students\u2019 questions and assessing their exercises. At the same time, they also make teaching programs on the computer to strengthen the substantial results of teaching and improve the efficiency. By these means, they have achieved great fruits.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>As to the advance technology of Interactive Whiteboard, we think it is a more functional teaching tool. So we decide to conduct the experiment of it in Class3, Class 9 and Class 10, Grade 11 . There are 513 students in this grade, and 152 students take part in the experimental project, nearly covering 30% of the total number.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Author:\u00a0Wang Zhenyu<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Publication Date:<\/strong>\u00a02005<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em>[s2If !is_user_logged_in()]<\/em><em><mark  class=\"x-highlight\" >More&#8230;
