At the same time curriculum reviews are progressing in other regions of the UK and internationally.\u00a0It is an exciting but challenging time for education and the place of computing technology within it. The questions that were asked by the ITTE community were:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">How should initial teacher education respond to these developments and how could continuing professional development evolve to maximise the potential of technology for professional learning? <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Can Computer\u00a0Science, IT and Digital Literacy be harmonised into a coherent and responsible curriculum for schools and students generating not only specialist subject knowledge but enriching the entire curriculum from PE, through Drama, and all the way to PSE?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The general conference themes were:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Redefining the computing curriculum<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What is the common knowledge base that underpins Computer Science, ICT and Digital Literacy?
