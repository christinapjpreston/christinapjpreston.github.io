ITTE, MirandaNet, London Knowledge Lab and the International Baccalaureate, the main partners, invited forty international experts to share their views. The aim was to gather a consensus in a debate on an overarching issue in a form that can be reported back to policy makers and curriculum designers. The debate question was: <i>This professional community believes the importance of ethics and values in relation to digital technologies are not emphasised sufficiently in today&#8217;s digital society. <\/i>\u00a0The conference explored three key themes linked to this debating topic: the concept of Digital Citizenship; the interplay between Computers Science, Social Informatics and Digital Wisdom. The group also looked at the implications these questions have for professional development.<br \/>\n<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">The methods of data collection were refined from existing knowledge creation formulae like the MirandaMods. Firstly, in order to record the perspectives of all the participants everyone published their view on the website before the event. Lead speakers introduced each topic and rapporteurs summarised the deliberations of each group of participants. Speakers were videoed. Opinions were also recorded during the day on post-its and concept mapping were encouraged on posters. Unfortunately the internet was not reliable enough to do digital collections like Twitter and collaborative digital concept maps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You can read more about the knowledge creation methods used in the event as well as the draft report <span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Towards-tomorrow\u00b9s-successful-digital-citizens.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Malcolm Payton and Christina Preston expect to be inviting views on the draft report at the ITTE conference on July 4th.<br \/>\nConference fees are subsidised by ITTE at \u00a320.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">You can sign up <\/span><span class=\"s3\">here<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itte.org.uk\/\"><span class=\"s4\">www.itte.org.uk<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;32px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][vc_column_text]\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\">BELOW ARE THE DETAILS OF THE ORIGINAL CONFERENCE.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Location: London Knowledge Lab, 23-29 Emerald Street London WC1N 3QS.United Kingdom.
