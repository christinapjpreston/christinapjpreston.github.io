Collaborative work is little used as a strategy and the opportunities for developing speaking and listening skills are limited due to class size of more than 50 and limited lesson times: it is hoped to develop strategies that will increase these.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is hoped to introduce more multimedia using the projector an whiteboard and the opportunity to freeze frame video and annotate<\/li>\n<li>The concept of using writing frameworks will be examined to see whether it improves students\u2019 performance or closes down the options of creative work and leads to generalised formulaic writing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>B) <\/em><\/strong>developing group projects, related to international citizenship ideas, ( <em>see more details in Liu Yan\u2019s ideas attachment<\/em>) for the students to work on \u2013 the themes will those being developed by the schools in Mexico and SA. The idea being that the University students provide material that can be used by the other participating schools in their classroom, thereby extending their knowledge and understanding of the whiteboard in action and at the same time developing their language skills in English by a close consideration of audience and purpose.
