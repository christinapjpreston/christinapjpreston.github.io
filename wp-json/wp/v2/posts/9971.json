In communicating the educational importance of the digital, in using it astutely and naturally in everyday teaching, in all the school\u2019s operations, and in assisting the children to use their own suite of digital technologies within and beyond school, such pathfinder schools are also unintentionally emphasising for their communities of students, parents, carers, grandparents (and all those with whom they are connected) that the digital is fundamentally important.<\/p>\n<p>Thus the school &#8211; particularly through its students &#8211; is helping to enhance the digital proficiency of all within its immediate community. The use of a school app for communication and interaction, the encouragement of the students to use appropriate technologies and the exploration by the students of emerging technologies all impact on the extended family\u2019s 24\/7\/365 use of the digital. Through this indirect influence the school can help to normalise the everyday usage of digital technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Significantly, as the school\u2019s community enhances its digital proficiency so too its expectations of and support for the digital in the school rise. Simultaneously, the school\u2019s wider community of families and participants, its \u2018digital community\u2019, invariably wear numerous hats as employees, local government officers, town planners, business owners, software developers and many others, all work within other regional digital ecosystems. This collective experience of interactions between digital ecosystems reveals the benefits for their children and their wider community and which benefits the entire region. Digital pathfinder schools who grow their school ecosystem will also grow their community, its life, culture, its digital proficiency and in time its industry. This is what Morris and Lowe<sup>[<a href=\"#3\">3<\/a>] <\/sup>found in their study of schools in the far south coast of Australia (Lee, Morris and Lowe, 2015).<\/p>\n<p>If that is so it takes the role of schooling, and in particular digital schools into a new, different and very powerful position. More research is needed to explore this relationship between the growth of digital ecosystems in schools and their effects on the wider social and economic environment but it is clear that, as a school\u2019s digital evolution progresses, a careful look at the interaction with other digital and networked ecosystems is important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a name=\"1\"><\/a>Digital ecosystem.
