Dr Christina Preston and Dr Sarah Younie, both of the Institute for Education Futures, De Montfort University and the MirandaNet Fellowship, discuss if this was the correct move and offer some suggestions on how to make ICT work in your school<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Schools have been presented with a huge challenge since 2014: to embed and integrate a new school subject into their curriculum, working with a teacher workforce that, while strongly motivated, have not had training in the subject knowledge. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.computingatschool.org.uk\/\">Computing at School<\/a> (CAS) organisation was founded to provide a professional group which teachers could turn to for advice and support. The government has offered modest support of around \u00a31m per annum through CAS but, spread over more than 100,000 teachers, it\u2019s a small sum with which to train, encourage and equip teachers to absorb a new syllabus with cross-curricula implications.<\/p>\n<h6>WHERE ARE ALL THE IT TEACHERS?<\/h6>\n<p>New figures reveal the government has, for the second year running, recruited only 70% of the 400 computer science teachers funds allow for. Dr Bill Mitchell, head of the British Computing Society, said that a country the size of England \u2013 with over 20,000 schools \u2013 probably needs closer to 1,000 CAS master teachers, not 400, adding that it could be another five years before teachers feel confident enough to successfully teach computing science.<\/p>\n<p>The problem for school business managers is not only that there\u2019s a shortage of \u2018qualified\u2019 teachers but also that there\u2019s no clear definition of what \u2018qualified\u2019 implies. The emphasis on computing science has led to a devaluing of a 30- year ICT skills\u2019 legacy; good ICT teachers have jumped ship as the message has been that their knowledge is no longer relevant. The ICT teachers we\u2019ve spoken to struggle with computing because of the degree of technical, pedagogical and skill level required to teach a deep understanding of computer science. Coding programs like Python and Scratch help bridge the gap, but computer science places extra demands on teachers trained to teach ICT.<\/p>\n<h6>TECHNICAL CPD<\/h6>\n<p>The CAS programme is admirable in that those who pass are expected to help train other teachers. However, Terry Freedman, an ICT consultant and journalist, argues that existing ICT teachers are reluctant to apply for computing training. Further, for those managing school budgets, while the CAS qualification is valuable, it\u2019s costly \u2013 especially given the current funding situation. For school business managers looking to support those teachers who want to equip their pupils for the digital world there\u2019s a range of online \u2018communities of practice\u2019 providing real support from peers, for example CAS (which has DfE and Microsoft backing). The <a href=\"https:\/\/education.microsoft.com\/\">Microsoft Educator Community<\/a>&nbsp;provides a resource for teachers to connect and share ideas and there\u2019s also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naace.co.uk\/\">Naace<\/a>, the education technology association, the<a href=\"http:\/\/itte.org.uk\"> Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education<\/a> (ITTE) whose members are teacher trainers in edtech, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alt.ac.uk\/\">Association for Learning Technologies<\/a> (ALT) whose members, largely from FE and HE, aim to improve practice, promote research and influence policy and. Our own organisation is the international <a href=\"\">MirandaNet Fellowship<\/a>&nbsp;where&nbsp;we&nbsp;focus on professional development programmes and practice-based research into innovation in classrooms particular those that enable and support effective teaching.<\/p>\n<p>All these groups share and support each other through membership of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.subjectassociations.org.uk\/\">Council for Subject Associations<\/a> and offer expert practitioner experience and knowledge to any colleagues who join. They offer an excellent starting point for anyone struggling to make sense of the new requirements of this brave new computer curriculum. They are also open organisations in that they all freely share and disseminate resources, skills and ideas about what they do. Today it is quite simple and low-cost to subscribe to the newsletters and mailing lists run by such groups or to join in discussion forums that some provide but are excellent ways to keep in touch with teachers in similar situations but who invariably have useful experience to offer.<\/p>\n<h6><em>Communities of Practice to join<\/em><\/h6>\n<p>Forums, newsletters, mailing lists, special interest groups, classroom resources, and current eeducational research can be found on some or all of these examples. Most require signing up for membership (mostly free, sometimes not) to access all the services and benefits.<\/p>\n<table class=\" aligncenter\" style=\"width: 566.8px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 276px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alt.ac.uk\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/alt-logo_0_0.png\" alt=\"ALT\" width=\"170\" height=\"103\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 285px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bcs.org\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/bcsLogoTop.png\" alt=\"BCS\" width=\"80\" height=\"98\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 295.8px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.besa.org.uk\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.besa.org.uk\/wp-content\/themes\/besa\/dist\/images\/besa-header-logo.svg\" alt=\"BESA\" width=\"231\" height=\"104\"><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 276px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.computingatschool.org.uk\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/logo_alt.png\" alt=\"CAS\" width=\"295\" height=\"64\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 285px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/subjectassociations.org.uk\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/subjectassociations.org.uk\/assets\/logo.gif\" alt=\"CfSA\" width=\"279\" height=\"90\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 295.8px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/gaiaonline.com\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8496 size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/gaiaonline.jpg\" alt=\"gaia online\" width=\"150\" height=\"71\"><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 276px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.innovatemyschool.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/innovatemyschool_logo.png\" alt=\"Innovate My School\" width=\"300\" height=\"113\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 285px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/itte.org.uk\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3061 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/ITTE.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"148\" height=\"94\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 295.8px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-3246 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/MESH-200x113-e1459937835480-150x55.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"55\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 276px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/education.microsoft.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/microsoft-gray.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Education\" width=\"216\" height=\"46\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 285px; text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5563 alignnone\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/mirandanet_fellowship_logo1-e1441112931354.jpg\" alt=\"MirandaNet Fellowship\" width=\"300\" height=\"121\"><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 295.8px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/naace.org.uk\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-7748 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/naace-partner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"61\"><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 276px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/community.tes.com\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8497 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/TES.jpg\" alt=\"TES\" width=\"99\" height=\"64\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 285px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.workingoutwhatworks.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.workingoutwhatworks.com\/~\/media\/ResearchED\/Site\/researchED-logo.jpg\" alt=\"ResearchED\" width=\"354\" height=\"65\"><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 295.8px;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[ Web editor note: this is a lightly edited version of the article that appeared in Education Executive, March 2017.
