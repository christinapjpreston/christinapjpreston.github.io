communities<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Professional development<\/h3>\n<p>The most robust online communities are those associated with professional development.\u00a0\u00a0 Participants have a common interest: the completion of a course; improving professional practice; demonstrating competence for legal purposes.\u00a0\u00a0 These communities are often structured by time (activities take place within a specific framework) or by outcome: tasks have to be completed if the individual is to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Motivational factors, therefore, form part of the online identity of the individual and the group.\u00a0\u00a0 Much of the theory of online communities is predicated on these factors.<\/p>\n<p>Online communities that focus on professional development are, by their very nature, exclusive.<\/p>\n<h3>Communities of Practice<\/h3>\n<p>Communities of Practice serve those who share common aims.\u00a0\u00a0 The success (or otherwise) of such communities depends on two significant factors: frequency of use, and congruence of interest.\u00a0\u00a0 The more tightly defined the interest, the more likely it will be that the needs of participants will be met.<\/p>\n<p>The proviso, however, unless the community reflects the interests and concerns of all members, the danger is that online activity will be dominated by a handful, who may not be representative of all.<\/p>\n<p>The most successful communities of practice are those that collaborate in meeting the needs of members, by fulfilling the Belbin role of Resource Investigation.\u00a0\u00a0 Such a community becomes an agent of distributed cognition: the knowledge constructed during the course of online activities can be accessed by all members of the community.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst communities of practice can be seen as inclusive, since all who have an interest in aims of the community can participate, the reality is often that there is a dominant discourse that precludes dissenting voices.<\/p>\n<h3>Communities of interest<\/h3>\n<p>Communities of Interest are perhaps the most frequently used types, although the growth of weblogs may serve to displace them.\u00a0\u00a0 Most organisations host online communities; forums for debate and discussion enable members to develop their views, opinions and positions of whatever topics are under discussion.\u00a0\u00a0 Less active members are able to read whatever has been published.<\/p>\n<p>The communities are inclusive: all who share an interest can feel a part of them.\u00a0 Despite this many such forums develop into limited discussion areas, with established voices within the community adopting the role of gatekeepers, effectively managing access for those new to the community.<\/p>\n<h2><em>Motivational Factors<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Early adopters<\/h3>\n<p>Many of those who are motivated to participate in online communities can be characterised as \u2018early adopters\u2019, whose access to, and understanding of, new communications technology facilitates online use.\u00a0\u00a0 Such users tend to persevere when difficulties are encountered, and see new projects as opportunities to be explored, rather than additional tasks that have to be undertaken.<\/p>\n<h3>Extrinsic factors<\/h3>\n<p>Some may be motivated to participate in online communities because of extrinsic factors: the need to keep up with colleagues; the desire to feel part of institutional change; the need to re-define personal identity.\u00a0\u00a0 In all these cases participation in an online community happens as a result of something else \u2013 it wasn\u2019t necessarily the starting point for the individual, and membership may only be a temporary phase.<\/p>\n<h3>Progression<\/h3>\n<p>The desire to move forward in one\u2019s professional life is a strong motivator for many users of an online community.\u00a0\u00a0 It has proved to be the case for participants in the NCSL\u2019s \u2018Talking Heads\u2019, many Learn Direct participants and all those who participate in online learning that leads to skills and qualifications.<\/p>\n<p>Membership of such communities therefore tends to be time-specific: when the course has been completed or the qualification achieved, the individual is likely to cease participation.\u00a0\u00a0 Having said that, however, there may well be a progression to other communities if the initial experience has been positive.<\/p>\n<h2><em>Integrating online work with teaching tasks<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Technologies<\/h3>\n<p>Most teachers in schools have to share ICT facilities with colleagues and students.\u00a0\u00a0 Few teachers have a dedicated computer to which they have access throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0 School or regional networks may often restrict access to specific web sites, or preclude the receipt of file attachments with email.<\/p>\n<p>Most teachers still rely on web-based email at school, since few are yet in the position of being able to download emails into an Inbox on a dedicated machine<\/p>\n<h3>Timetables<\/h3>\n<p>The constraints of timetables and access to resources effectively restrict online activities by teachers to the end of the school day.\u00a0\u00a0 This separation of practice from the reflection made possible by participation in an online community of practice reinforces the division between theory and practice that has been such a feature of education in England.<\/p>\n<h3>Teaching<\/h3>\n<p>Teaching is teaching and e-learning is not.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the biggest conceptual hurdles for teachers to overcome.\u00a0\u00a0 The nature of the curriculum, the ways in which the teacher\u2019s role has been defined and assessed and the perception \u2013 which I think is wrong \u2013 that there\u2019s no freedom of movement for a teacher, have all conspired to produce the feeling amongst many teachers that e-learning has little relevance to \u2018actually existing teaching\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>One consequence of this has been that even those online communities of practice that focus on specific curriculum areas are often dominated by discussions that have a negative focus.<\/p>\n<h2><em>eFacilitating colleagues<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Patterns of discourse<\/h3>\n<p>Gender plays a large part in e-facilitation discourse.\u00a0\u00a0 Males often engage in a colloquy: threads run in parallel (or even opposition), with little sense of either party being engaged with the other.\u00a0\u00a0 This surface tension is rarely reflected in the online conversations of non-males.\u00a0\u00a0 This is not to say, however, that male online discourse fails to construct knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0 What often happens is that knowledge is created internally, rather than in the public forums.<\/p>\n<p>A further complication of educational forums is that participants make a series of assertions during the course of a debate, in similar ways in which student discussion is stimulated in a class.<\/p>\n<h3>Expectations<\/h3>\n<p>The expectations that form a part of online communities, and which are conducive to e-facilitation, are rarely focused on achieving specific outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0 Where an online forum is set up within an institution, for the specific purpose of achieving common outcomes, the process of e-facilitation is subtly changed: many of the participants have the implicit feeling that the facilitator must know what is wanted, and they therefore expect to be steered in that direction.<\/p>\n<h3>Outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>The most effective outcomes are those that are shared, where the work proceeds collaboratively.\u00a0\u00a0 This is often in tension with work in the classroom, which is individual \u2013 solitary, even.<\/p>\n<h2><em>Ways forward<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Integrating tasks<\/h3>\n<p>Within an institutional context the use of an online community to support work (for example, the teaching and learning group in the context of my own study) it may well be that the initial focus of online participation should be to create and upload an artefact that is then discussed and modified.\u00a0\u00a0 This blended approach could well be an effective start, so that the online community is seen as a repository of distributed cognition.<\/p>\n<p>This may well be an essential first phase.<\/p>\n<h3>Managed environments<\/h3>\n<p>The use of managed learning environments may promote the concept of online community work.\u00a0\u00a0 When these form part of teachers\u2019 working days, and when the environment provides opportunities to access or create curriculum material, the conceptual shift to regarding ICT environments as an integral part of professional practice may have been achieved.<\/p>\n<h3>Access to technology<\/h3>\n<p>All of these steps require teachers to have constant online access to resources and communities during the school day.\u00a0\u00a0 The transition to wireless networks, and the provision of laptop computers as part of a teacher\u2019s professional toolkit, would provide the most flexible way in which ICT and e-learning can be integrated into teacher praxis.<\/p>\n<h2><em>Conclusions<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Shared resources<\/h3>\n<p>Shared resources to support learning across the curriculum, rather than subject-specific resources, are likely to be the most effective support that teachers can be given.<\/p>\n<p>Teachers can supply the curriculum content: the learning framework into which the materials fit are the more necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 And it is these frameworks that should form the focus of online communities of practice.<\/p>\n<h3>Collaborative work<\/h3>\n<p>The most effective curriculum development initiatives have come from the collaborative efforts of teachers.\u00a0\u00a0 The current online paradigm, of linear text-based forums, does not necessarily support that approach.\u00a0\u00a0 Part of the work of online communities should be to investigate alternate models to support collaborative work.<\/p>\n<h3>Development time<\/h3>\n<p>The nature of teaching is such that there is little space in the working day for reflection, and limited opportunity for development time outside training days.<\/p>\n<p>The opportunities that the e-facilitator scholars have had have proved invaluable in the development of concepts and practice.\u00a0\u00a0 If teachers are to be able to shape the future of education then time for reflection and development should form part of their professional development framework.<\/p>\n<h1>Learning about Learning<\/h1>\n<h2><em>UK e-Learning Strategy<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Definitions of learning<\/h3>\n<p>One of the interesting factors in current writing about e-learning is the way in which definitions are predicated in terms of content and delivery, with learning being an activity undertaken by learners.<\/p>\n<p>This essentially pragmatic and English concept of learning neatly sidesteps debate over which learning theory may be privileged over another \u2013 or, indeed, whether there can be such as thing as a learning theory.\u00a0\u00a0 What it means, however, is that, for many people, e-learning is conflated with e-teaching.<\/p>\n<p>Attractive as it may be to conduct one\u2019s teaching from a tranquil office, with autonomous learners at their remote terminals, the messy reality and intersections of society, working parents, absurd property prices and feckless youth demands that some degree of immurement is required for at least part of each day.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s the conceptual sticking point for the integration of e-learning into schools.\u00a0\u00a0 Teachers can see the virtues of online curriculum materials; of home-school links; of online management tools: beyond that, focus disappears.<\/p>\n<h3>Directions for learning<\/h3>\n<p>In \u2018Technologies that do not crash: a systematic, conceptual framework for teachers\u2019 Bednar and Sweeder argue that effective learning technology consists of three parts.\u00a0\u00a0 The analogy they use is drawn from earth science: learning should be seen in holistic terms, but in order for us as educators to make it effective we should structure our approach in the same way as the Earth is structured, as core, mantle and crust.\u00a0\u00a0 (Bednar, M.; Sweeder, J. (2003)\u00a0\u00a0 Technologies that do not crash: a systematic, conceptual framework for teachers\u00a0\u00a0 International Conference on Innovation in Higher Education\u00a0\u00a0 Kiev, Ukraine)<\/p>\n<p>The Core Idea Technologies include Piaget\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Development, Gardner\u2019s Multiple Intelligence Theory, Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development, Vygotsky\u2019s Social-Constructivist Theory of Social Development and so on.<\/p>\n<p>The Mantle Idea Technologies \u2013 the second tier \u2013 include Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy, Flower and Hayes\u2019s Writing Process, Problem Based Learning, Bruner\u2019s Modes of Representation and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Crust Idea technologies, the Third Tier, include all of the deductive, inductive and transaction domain-specific teaching and learning strategies used within the classroom.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge for us, when we conceptualise e-learning, therefore, is to incorporate these three tiers within our concepts, rather than simply focusing on the instrumental final tier.<\/p>\n<h3>Institutional control and individual expectations<\/h3>\n<p>The final issue with the move to e-learning is that of institutional control, and the ways in which that can clash with individual expectations of learning, whether of teachers, students or parents.\u00a0\u00a0 When students learn outside the institution, and when their style of learning and approach to learning is very different from that set by the institution, which is the style that will prevail?<\/p>\n<h2><em>Language and Learning<\/em><\/h2>\n<h3>Language and concepts<\/h3>\n<p>The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis identifies a strong causal link between language acquisition and use, concept formation and performative competence.<\/p>\n<p>Ways in which curriculum requirements are set down prescribe the ways in which the language of learning is used, and the ways in which learning will be tested and assessed to ensure that it has taken place.<\/p>\n<p>The expectation, therefore, would be that before someone can form concepts (which predicate performance) they need to have the language.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of education, that means that we have to teach the language \u2013 and the concepts, just to make sure.<\/p>\n<h3>The language of autonomy<\/h3>\n<p>An alternative perspective is that of Winograd and Flores (1988\u00a0\u00a0 Understanding, Computers and Cognition.\u00a0\u00a0 Reading, Ma.\u00a0\u00a0 Addison Wesley).\u00a0\u00a0 Their thesis is that the use of a new tool produces changes in the language that we use, and the language shift occasions changes in the ways in which we think.\u00a0\u00a0 The implications of this interpretation are that young people can know <em>how<\/em> to do something without necessarily having the language in which to explain their concepts.\u00a0\u00a0 This has implications for the ways in which we teach and test learner competence.<\/p>\n<p>For a full discussion of these issues see Chapter 7 \u2018Concepts of mind: A developmental picture\u2019 in: Cuthell, J.
