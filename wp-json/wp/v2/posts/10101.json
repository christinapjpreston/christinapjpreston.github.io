Another common factor is the lack of time provided for teachers to embed new learning into their professional practice.<\/p>\n<p>Where there has been success the group of international, national or regional leaders have often benefitted from a strong professional community of practice that can supply &#8216;just in time&#8217; advice as required. Professor Niki Davis, a MirandaNet Senior Fellow now in New Zealand has documented our progress as an element in the international Arena model she has developed. This complex model shows how many different layers of community have to be considered in an edtech in schools campaign in any country (Davis 2017).<\/p>\n<p>A good online platform is essential for communication, teaching and publication. But teachers do not use online facilities readily. Being part of the learning community is the best motivator and effective ementoring is essential. Few ementors are given professional development although this is a very new and complex skill.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1992 MirandaNet 5.0 and ITTE members have been refining a practice-based research model, iCatalyst, that we have deployed in schools and regions in the Czech Republic, China, India, Mexico, South Africa and the UK. These projects have been funded by governments, charities and MirandaNet associate companies who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hayamix.com\/\">hayamix.com<\/a> want to develop their product or service to enhance teaching and learning. Different members of the group can elect to undertake the programme at certificate, diploma or at 30 point Masters level. The success rests on the fact that the leaders and teachers decide what questions they want to ask and take charge of the classroom experiments and data collection. Any changes the school adopts as a result of the programme are based on the evidence that leaders, teachers and the pupils have agreed.<\/p>\n<p>We have also documented the reasons why the teacher profession is often reluctant to use digital technologies and the barriers that need to be respected. We find that the best way to overcome these legitimate concerns is to involve the teachers in the management of change rather than forcing change on them.<\/p>\n<p>This model is also valuable for adult learners as it is an investigative process that is being embedded.
