On Thursday 7th in the afternoon, other MirandaNetters will join in online using a range of such digital communications technologies such as video conferencing, microblogging and collaborative concept maps that emphasise the social element of learning. This professional development event is thus widely disseminated, both synchronously and asynchronously. The resulting resources that will include collaborative publications are archived on the MirandaNet website.<\/p>\n<p>All the participants are considered to be equal in importance. Invited experts on key topics only talk for about 10 minutes plus questions preferably without using presentation software. These talks are expected to promote democratic engagement within the groups informed by the expert inputs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Partners<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This international \u2018Poskole\u2019 community of leaders in digital technologies in education and the Czech Miranda have been holding events and publishing together since the early 1990s. This year we have invited MirandaNet associates and colleagues from the new Learning Futures Research Centre at the University of Bedfordshire to join us. As a result there will be about twenty five participants from Bulgaria, England, Germany, Slovakia, The Czech Republic and The Netherlands sharing our latest ideas about educational innovation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/researchexchange\/events-2\/how-can-digital-technologies-support-learners-prague-6th-10th-june\/poskole-professional-knowledge-creators\/\">The Participants<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Programme<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2><strong><strong>Wednesday June 6th from 1500.<\/strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Expert input<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1500<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1630<\/strong> Dr Marilyn Leask, Professor of Educational Knowledge Management, Learning Futures Research Centre, University of Bedfordshire: <strong>What is the value of sharing professional knowledge in the 21st century?<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>Prof. Ivan Kalas, Comenius University Bratislava:<strong> What and how to teach about ICT in 21<sup>st<\/sup> century<\/strong><\/div>\n<p>Dr Bozena Mannova: Czech Miranda, Czech Technical University <strong>What kind of 21st century problems can be solved by computers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Antonin Novak and Tomas Baca, Gymnasium Arabska students, <strong>Presentation of the winning project of Czech High School research competition.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1600 Coffee break and discussion with students<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1700-1830 \u2013 Getting organised<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Introductions, deciding on working groups, deciding group leaders and building consensus on the unconference programme.
